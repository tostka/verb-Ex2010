    REVISIONS
    # 5:12 PM 10/13/2021 fixed long standing random add-adgroupmember bug (failed to see target sg/dg), by swapping in ADGM ex cmd;  pulled [int] from $ticket , to permit non-numeric & multi-tix
    # 11:36 AM 9/16/2021 string
    # 10:27 AM 9/14/2021 beefed up echos w 7pswhsplat's pre
    # 3:21 PM 8/17/2021 recoded grabbing outputs, on object creations in EMS, tho' AD object creations generate no proper output. functoinal on current ticket.
    # 4:48 PM 8/16/2021 still wrestling grant fails, switched the *permission -user targets to the dg object.primarysmtpaddr (was adg.samaccountname), if the adg.sama didn't match the alias, that woulda caused failures. Seemd to work better in debugging
    # 1:51 PM 6/30/201:51 PM 6/30/2021 trying to work around sporadic $oSG add-mailboxperm fails, played with -user $osg designator - couldn't use DN, went back to samacctname, but added explicit RETRY echos on failretries (was visible evid at least one retry was in mix) ; hardened up the report gathers - stuck thge get-s in a try/catch ahead of echos, (vs inlines) ; we'll see if the above improve the issue - another option is to build something that can parse the splt echo back into a functional splat, to at least make remediation easier (copy, convert, rerun on fly).
    # 4:21 PM 5/19/2021 added -ea STOP to splats, to force retry's to trigger
    # 5:03 PM 5/18/2021 fixed the fundementally borked start-log I created below
    # 11:10 AM 5/11/2021 swapped parentpath code for dyn module-support code (moving the new-mailboxgenerictor & add-mbxaccessgrant preproc .ps1's to ex2010 mod functions)

    # 1:27 PM 4/23/2020 updated loadmod & dynamic logging/exec code
    # 4:28 PM 4/22/2020 updated logging code, to accomodate dynamic locations and $ParentPath
    # 3:37 PM 4/9/2020 works fully on jumpbox, but ignores whatif, renamed $bwhatif -> $whatif (as the b variant was prev set in the same-script, now separate scopes); swapped out CU5 switch, moved settings into infra file, genericized
    # 1:38 PM 4/9/2020 modularized updated to reflect debugging on jumpbox
    # 9:57 AM 9/27/2019 added `a beep to all "YYY" prompts to draw attn
    # 12:50 PM 6/13/2019 repl get-timestamp() -> Get-Date -Format 'HH:mm:ss' throughout

    # 11:43 AM 2/15/2019 debugged update through a prod revision
    # 11:15 AM 2/15/2019 copied in bug-fixed write-log() with fixed debug support

    # 8:36 AM 9/6/2018 switched secgrp to Global->Universal scope, mail-enabled as DG, and hiddenfromaddressbook, debugged out issues, used in prod creation
    # 10:28 AM 6/27/2018 add $domaincontroller param option - skips dc discovery process and uses the spec, also updated $findOU code to work with torolab dom
    # 11:05 AM 3/29/2018 #1116: added trycatch, UST lacked the secgrp ou and was failing ou lookup
    # 10:31 AM 11/22/2017 shifted a block of "User mbx grant:" confirmation into review block, also tightened up the formatted whitespace to make the material pasted into cw reflect all that you need to know on the grant status. also added distrib code
    # 1:17 PM 11/15/2017 949: no, this needs to be the obj (was extracting samaccountname)
    # 12:35 PM 11/15/2017 debugged EXO-hosted Owner code to function. worked granting lynctest18 (exo) access to shared 'SharedTestEXOOwner' OP

    # 11:29 AM 6/23/2017 fix typos, added 'DomainControler', without the vari-spec $
    # 8:16 AM 6/23/2017 we're getting mismatches/misses on AD work - prolly because we're using the -server $domain, rather than a SPECIFIC GC! replic lag is killing us!
    #   switch to the same gc the Ex cmds are using
    #   rplc -server $($InputSplat.Domain)  -> -server $($InputSplat.DomainController)
    #   rplc -server $Domain -> -server $($DomainController)
    # 1:41 PM 6/13/2017 spliced in latest 3/16/16 get-gcfast()
    # 1:37 PM 5/30/2017 855: pretest get-command, fails if it doesn't even have it at all
    # 1:21 PM 5/30/2017 1484: block that adds the $tmbx to the maintain-offboards.ps1 target AccGrant group for the region
    # 1:20 PM 5/30/2017 pencil in new AG group add when grant is done.
    # 11:27 AM 5/22/2017 add $NoPrompt
    # 9:44 AM 3/2/2017 suppress ID null errors on close BP

    # 9:41 AM 3/2/2017 merged in updated Add-EMSRemote Set
    # 9:07 AM 3/2/2017: Add-EMSRemote set: Example code:  Don't force load EMS/Add-EMSRemote if there's an existing functional get-exchangeserver command (suppress clobber errors)
    # 9:07 AM 3/2/2017 Don't force load EMS/Add-EMSRemote if there's an existing functional get-exchangeserver command (suppress clobber errors)
    # 12:15 PM 2/27/2017 trailing membership test was still failing, tore out blocks of new code and recycled what's used up in the Existing quote who cares if it's a DN vs a name
    # 12:11 PM 2/27/2017 fixed compat in SPB (prolly ADL too) - resolved any Owner entered as email, to the samaccountname ; #1081: drop the pipe!
     $oSG | Get-ADGroupMember -server $Domain | select distinguishedName ; #1263 threw up trying to do the get-aduser on the members, # 1283 replace user lookup with this (skip the getxxx member, pull members right out of properties)
    # 1:04 PM 2/24/2017 tweak below
    #12:56 PM 2/24/2017 doesn't run worth a damn LYN-> adl/spb, force it to abort (avoid half-built remote objects that take too long to replicate back to lyn)
    # 12:24 PM 2/24/2017 fixed updated membership report bug - pulled pipe, probably dehydrated object issue sin remote ps
    # 12:11 PM 2/24/2017 fix vscode/code.exe char set damage: It replaced dashes (-) with "ï¿½"
    # fix -join typo/damage

    # 9:11 AM 9/30/2016 added pretest if(get-command -name set-AdServerSettings -ea 0)
    # # 12:22 PM 6/21/2016 secgrp membership seldom comes through clean, add a refresh loop
    # 10:52 AM 6/20/2016 fixed typo $InputSplatSiteOverride => $InputSplat.SiteOverride (broke -SiteOverride function)
    # 11:02 AM 6/7/2016 updated get-aduser review cmds to use the same dc, not the -domain global.ad.toro.com etc
    # 1:34 PM 5/26/2016 confirmed/verified works fine with SPB-hosted mbx under 376336 issitjx
    # 11:45 AM 5/19/2016 corrected $tmbx ref's to use $tmbx.identity v. $tmbx.samaccountname, now working. Retry code in place for SPB, but it didn't trigger during testing
    # 2:37 PM 5/18/2016 implmented Secgrp OU and Secgrp stnd name
    # 2:28 PM 5/18/2016 With the recent AD changes, all email access groups should be named         XXX-SEC-Email-firstname lastname-G     and stored in XXX\Managed Groups\SEC Groups\Email Access.     The generics were also renamed to XXX\Generic Email Accounts.
    # 2:17 PM 5/10/2016 used successfully to set a LYN manager perm's on an SPBMS640Mail02-hosted user. didn't time out, Set-MailboxPermission command completed after ~3 secs
    #     fixed bad param example, remmed out non-functional Owner in the SGSplat (nosuch param), and re-enabled the ManagedBy on the SG - it's not a mbx,
    #     so why not set ManagedBy, doesn't get used by the org chart in SP
    # 2:38 PM 3/17/2016 stop populating anything into any managed-by; it's an OrgChart political value now. Rename ManagedBy param and object names in here to 'Owner'
    # 1:12 PM 2/11/2016 fixed new bug in get-GCFast, wasn't detecting blank $site
    # 12:20 PM 2/11/2016 updated to standard EMS/AD Call block & Add-EMSRemote()
    # 9:36 AM 2/11/2016 just shifting to a single copy, with no # Requires at all, losing the -psv2.ps1 version
    # 2:23 PM 2/10/2016 debugged mismatched {}, working from SPB now
    # 1:54 PM 2/10/2016 recoded to work on SPB and ADL, this version just needs the #Requires -Version 3 for psv2 enabled to be a psv3 version
    #         added fundemental upgrade to the AD Site detection, to work from SPB/Spellbrook and ADL Adeliade
    # 12:07 PM 2/10/2016 Psv2 variant - at this point, the only real diff is the rem'd rem'd #Requires -Version 3 for psv2
    # 7:40 AM Add-EMSRemote: 2/5/2016 another damn cls REM IT! I want to see all the connectivity info, switched wh->wv, added explicit echo's of what it's doing.
    # 10:41 AM 1/13/2016 updated Add-EMSRemote set & removed Clear-Host's
    # 10:02 AM 1/13/2016: fixed cls bug due to spurious ";cls" included in the try/catch boilerplate: Write-Error "$((get-date).ToString('HH:mm:ss')): Command: $($_.InvocationInfo.MyCommand)" ;cls => Write-Error "$((get-date).ToString('HH:mm:ss')): Command: $($_.InvocationInfo.MyCommand)" ;
    # 1:02 PM 12/18/2015 missing SYD as well
    # 11:42 AM 12/18/2015: building a Psv2-compliant version (-psv2.ps1):

    - sub out all [ordered] (-psv2 only)
    - rem'd #Requires -Version 3 (-psv2 only)
    - added explicit .tostring() in front of all string handlers (.substring() etc) (added to both versions)
    # 3:08 PM 10/29/2015 added in XIA aware from other recent script updates, and -server xxx to all get-ad* that didn't have it
    #2:49 PM 10/29/2015 add entire MEL site, nothing in the OU or Secgrp name switch blocks
    # 9:08 AM 10/14/2015 added debugpref maint code to get write-debug to work
    # 8:04 AM 10/14/2015 add sendAS adperms
    # 7:31 AM 10/14/2015 added -dc specs to all *-user & *-mailbox cmds, to ensure we're pulling back data from same dc that was updated in the set-* commands
    # 7:19 AM 10/14/2015 fixed some typos, made sure all $InputSplat.domaincontroller were $()'d
    # 9:13 AM 10/12/2015 force $Grantsplat=$Tmbx to use $Tmbx.Samacctname, defaulting to displayname which isn't consistently resolvable, samacctname should be.
    # 1:17 PM 10/6/2015 update to spec, seems to work
    # splice in Add-EMSRemote set & get-gcfast
    # 10:49 AM 10/6/2015: updated vers of Get-AdminInitials
    # 2:49 PM 10/2/2015 updated catch block to be detailed
    # 10:57 AM 8/14/2015 defaulted PermsDays to 60 (was going to 999)
    # 10:46 AM 8/14/2015 add param examples for the PermsDays spec
    # 9:35 AM 8/14/2015 updated params examples to reflect use of -ticket & -siteoverride
    # 11:00 AM 8/12/2015 also add an Info ref for the admin doing the work
    # 10:37 AM 8/12/2015 I see from dumping all matching secgrps ...
      $AllSGs = Get-ADGroup  -filter {GroupCategory  -eq "Security"  -and GroupScope -eq "Global"} -properties info,description;
      $AllSGs = $AllSgs |?{$_.Name -match "^\w{3}-(SEC|Data)-Email-.*$"} ; ($AllSGs | measure).count ;
      # have to 2-stage filter as the get-adgroup -filter has no -match regex operator support
      ... that dawn used to use these, oldest record I see, was from 2005, most recent appears to have been 2011. But she was recording sometimes recording the incident req# - which is a useful item to include (esp if you don't want folks monkeyin with the Notes/Info
      value and breaking automation to clean these up!).
      So we need to add incident number to the add-MbxAccessGrant.ps1, that means a parameter and a 3rd line in the Info append
    #11:32 AM 8/5/2015 fixed trailing ) in Updated IRO-SEC-Email-Jodie Gilroy-G)
    #11:43 AM 7/20/2015 line 197added a :space after displayname:

    REVISIONS   :
    * 1:30 PM 9/5/2024 added  update-SecurityProtocolTDO() SB to begin
    * 3:11 PM 7/15/2024 needed to change CHKPREREQ to check for presence of prop, not that it had a value (which fails as $false); hadn't cleared $MetaProps = ...,'DOESNTEXIST' ; confirmed cxo working non-based
    * 10:47 AM 7/11/2024 cleared debugging NoSuch etc meta tests
    * 1:34 PM 6/21/2024 ren $Global:E10Sess -> $Global:EXOPSess ; add: prereq checks, and $isBased support, to devert into most connect-exchangeServerTDO, get-ADExchangeServerTDO 100% generic fall back support (including buffering in the pair of funcs)
    # 9:43 AM 7/27/2021 revised -PSTitleBar to support suffix EMS[ctl]
    # 1:31 PM 7/21/2021 revised Add-PSTitleBar $sTitleBarTag with TenOrg spec (for prompt designators)
    # 3:18 PM 5/18/2021 somehow lost $credOpTORSID, so flipped lost default $credOPTor -> $credTORSID
    * 11:40 AM 5/14/2021 added -ea 0 to the gv tests (suppresses not-found error when called without logging config)
    * 11:22 AM 4/21/2021 coded around recent 'verbose the heck out of everything', yanked 99% of the verbose support - this seldom fails in a way that you need verbose, and when it's on, every cmdlet in the modules get echo'd, spams the heck out of console & logging. One key change (not sure if source) was to switch from inline import-pss & import-mod, into 2 steps with varis.
    * 10:02 AM 4/12/2021 add alias connect-ExOP (eventually rename verb-ex2010 to verb-exOnPrem)
    * 12:06 PM 4/2/2021 added alias cxOP ; added explicit echo on import-session|module, removed redundant catch block; added trycatch around import-sess|mod ; added recStatus support
    # 8:34 AM 3/31/2021 added verbose suppress to all import-mods ; renamed-standardized splat names (EMSSplat ->pltNSess ; ) ; flipped prefix into splat add ;
    * 2:36 PM 3/23/2021 getting away from dyn, random from array in $XXXMeta.Ex10Server, doesn't rely on AD lookups for referrals
    * 10:14 AM 3/23/2021 flipped default $Cred spec, pointed at an OP cred (matching reconnect-ex2010())
    * 11:36 AM 3/5/2021 updated colorcode, subed wv -verbose with just write-verbose, added cred.uname echo
    * 1:15 PM 3/1/2021 added org-level color-coded console
    * 3:28 PM 2/17/2021 updated to support cross-org, leverages new $XXXMeta.ExRevision, ExViewForest
    * 5:16 PM 10/22/2020 switched to no-loop meta lookup; debugged, fixed
    * 7:13 AM 7/22/2020 replaced codeblock w get-TenantTag(), flipped ExAdmin fr switch to un-typed
    * 5:11 PM 7/21/2020 added VEN support
    * 12:20 PM 5/27/2020 moved aliases: Add-EMSRemote,cx10 win func
    * 10:13 AM 5/15/2020 with vpn AD Ex lookup issue, patched in backup pass of get-ExchangeServerFromExGroup, in case of fail ; added failthrough to updated get-ExchangeServerFromExGroup, and finally to profile $smtpserver
    * 10:19 AM 2/24/2020 Connect-Ex2010/-OBS v1.1.0: updated cx10 to reflect infra file cred name change: cred####SID -> cred###SID, debugged, working, updated output banner to draw from global session, rather than imported module (was blank output). Ren'ing this one to the primary vers, and the prior to -OBS. Changed attribution, other than function names & concept, none of the code really sources back to Mike's original any more.
    * 6:59 PM 1/15/2020 cleanup
    * 7:51 AM 12/5/2019 Connect-Ex2010:retooled $ExAdmin variant webpool support - now has detect in the server-pick logic, and on failure, it retries to the stock pool.
    * 8:55 AM 11/27/2019 expanded $Credential support to switch to torolab & - potentiall/uncfg'd - CMW mail infra. Fw seems to block torolab access (wtf)
    * # 7:54 AM 11/1/2017 add titlebar tag & updated example to test for pres of Add-PSTitleBar
    * 12:09 PM 12/9/2016 implented and debugged as part of verb-Ex2010 set
    * 2:37 PM 12/6/2016 ported to local EMSRemote
    * 2/10/14 posted version
    $Credential can leverage a global: $Credential = $global:SIDcred

                * 12:57 PM 6/11/2024 Validated, Ex2010 & Ex2019, hub, mail & edge roles: tested ☑️ on CMW mail role (Curly); and Jumpbox; 
                    copied in CBH from repo copy, which has been updated/debugged compat on CMW Edge 
                    includes local snapin detect & load for edge role (simplest EMS load option for Edge role, from David Paulson's original code; no longer published with Ex2010 compat)
                * 11:28 AM 5/30/2024 fixed failure to recognize existing functional PSSession; Made substantial update in logic, validate works fine with other orgs, and in our local orgs.
                * 4:02 PM 8/28/2023 debuged, updated CBH, renamed connect-ExchangeSErver -> Connect-ExchangeServerTDO (avoid name clashes, pretty common verb-noun combo).
                * 12:36 PM 8/24/2023 init

                .DESCRIPTION
                Connect-ExchangeServerTDO.ps1 - Dependancy-less Function that, fed an Exchange server name, or AD SiteName, and optional RoleNames array, 
                will obtain a list of Exchange servers from AD (in the specified scope), and then run the list attempting to PowershellRemote (REMS) connect to each server, 
                stopping at the first successful connection.

                Relies upon/requires get-ADExchangeServerTDO(), to return a descriptive summary of the Exchange server(s) revision etc, for connectivity logic.
                Supports Exchange 2010 through 2019, as implemented.
            
                Intent, as contrasted with verb-EXOP/Ex2010 is to have no local module dependancies, when running EXOP into other connected orgs, where syncing profile & supporting modules code can be problematic. 
                This uses native ADSI calls, which are supported by Windows itself, without need for external ActiveDirectory module etc.

                The particular approach inspired by BF's demo func that accompanied his take on get-adExchangeServer(), which I hybrided with my own existing code for cred-less connectivity. 
                I added get-OrganizationConfig testing, for connection pre/post confirmation, along with Exchange Server revision code for continutional handling of new-pssession remote powershell EMS connections.
                Also shifted connection code into _connect-EXOP() internal func.
                As this doesn't rely on local module presnece, it doesn't have to do the usual local remote/local invocation detection you'd do for non-dehydrated on-server EMS (more consistent this way, anyway; 
                there are only a few cmdlet outputs I'm aware of, that have fundementally broken returns dehydrated, and require local non-remote EMS use to function.

                My core usage would be to paste the function into the BEGIN{} block for a given remote org process, to function as a stricly local ad-hoc function.

                PS> $PSSession = Connect-ExchangeServerTDO -siteName SITENAME -RoleNames @('HUB','CAS') -verbose 
                Demo's connecting to a functional Hub or CAS server in the SITENAME site with verbose outputs, the `PSSession variable will contain information about the successful connection. Makes automatic Exchangeserver discovery calls into AD (using ADSI) leveraging the separate get-ADExchangeServerTDO()
                .EXAMPLE
                PS> TRY{$Site=[System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.ActiveDirectorySite]::GetComputerSite().Name}CATCH{$Site=$env:COMPUTERNAME} ;
                PS> $PSSession = Connect-ExchangeServerTDO -siteName $Site -RoleNames @('HUB','CAS') -verbose ; 
                Demo including support for EdgeRole, which is detected on it's lack of AD Site specification (which gets fed through to call, by setting the Site to the machine itself).

                REVISIONS
                * 12:57 PM 6/11/2024 Validated, Ex2010 & Ex2019, hub, mail & edge roles: tested ☑️ on CMW mail role (Curly); and Jumpbox; copied in CBH from repo copy, which has been updated/debugged compat on CMW Edge 
                * 2:05 PM 8/28/2023 REN -> Get-ExchangeServerInSite -> get-ADExchangeServerTDO (aliased orig); to better steer profile-level options - including in cmw org, added -TenOrg, and default Site to constructed vari, targeting new profile $XXX_ADSiteDefault vari; Defaulted -Roles to HUB,CAS as well.
                * 3:42 PM 8/24/2023 spliced together combo of my long-standing, and some of the interesting ideas BF's version had. Functional prod:
                    - completely removed ActiveDirectory module dependancies from BF's code, and reimplemented in raw ADSI calls. Makes it fully portable, even into areas like Edge DMZ roles, where ADMS would never be installed.

                * 3:17 PM 8/23/2023 post Edge testing: some logic fixes; add: -Names param to filter on server names; -Site & supporting code, to permit lookup against sites *not* local to the local machine (and bypass lookup on the local machine) ; 
                    ren $Ex10siteDN -> $ExOPsiteDN; ren $Ex10configNC -> $ExopconfigNC
                * 1:03 PM 8/22/2023 minor cleanup
                * 10:31 AM 4/7/2023 added CBH expl of postfilter/sorting to draw predictable pattern 
                * 4:36 PM 4/6/2023 validated Psv51 & Psv20 and Ex10 & 16; added -Roles & -RoleNames params, to perform role filtering within the function (rather than as an external post-filter step). 
                For backward-compat retain historical output field 'Roles' as the msexchcurrentserverroles summary integer; 
                use RoleNames as the text role array; 
                    updated for psv2 compat: flipped hash key lookups into properties, found capizliation differences, (psv2 2was all lower case, wouldn't match); 
                flipped the [pscustomobject] with new... psobj, still psv2 doesn't index the hash keys ; updated for Ex13+: Added  16  "UM"; 20  "CAS, UM"; 54  "MBX" Ex13+ ; 16385 "CAS" Ex13+ ; 16439 "CAS, HUB, MBX" Ex13+
                Also hybrided in some good ideas from SammyKrosoft's Get-SKExchangeServers.psm1

                .DESCRIPTION
                get-ADExchangeServerTDO.ps1 - Returns Exchangeserver summary(s) from AD records

                Hybrided together ideas from Brian Farnsworth's blog post
                [PowerShell - ActiveDirectory and Exchange Servers – CodeAndKeep.Com – Code and keep calm...](https://codeandkeep.com/PowerShell-ActiveDirectory-Exchange-Part1/)
                ... with much older concepts from  Sammy Krosoft, and much earlier Mike Pfeiffer. 

                - Subbed in MP's use of ADSI for ActiveDirectory Ps mod cmds - it's much more dependancy-free; doesn't require explicit install of the AD ps module
                ADSI support is built into windows.
                - spliced over my addition of Roles, RoleNames, Name & NoTest params, for prefiltering and suppressing testing.


                [briansworth · GitHub](https://github.com/briansworth)

                Uses an ADSI DirectorySearcher to search the current Active Directory site for Exchange on-prem servers.
                        Intent is to discover connection points for Powershell, wo the need to preload/pre-connect to Exchange.

                        But, as a non-Exchange-Management-Shell-dependant info source on Exchange Server configs, it can be used before connection, with solely AD-available data, to check configuration spes on the subject server(s). 

                        For example, this query will return sufficient data under Version to indicate which revision of Exchange is in use:


                        Returned object (in array):
                        Site      : {ADSITENAME}
                        Roles     : {64}
                        Version   : {Version 15.1 (Build 32375.7)}
                        Name      : SERVERNAME
                        RoleNames : EDGE
                        FQDN      : SERVERNAME.DOMAIN.TLD

                        ... includes the post-filterable Role property ($_.Role -contains 'CAS') which reflects the following
                        installed-roles ('msExchCurrentServerRoles') on the discovered servers
                            2   {"MBX"} # Ex10
                            4   {"CAS"}
                            16  {"UM"}
                            20  {"CAS, UM" -split ","} # 
                            32  {"HUB"}
                            36  {"CAS, HUB" -split ","}
                            38  {"CAS, HUB, MBX" -split ","}
                            54  {"MBX"} # Ex13+
                            64  {"EDGE"}
                            16385   {"CAS"} # Ex13+
                            16439   {"CAS, HUB, MBX"  -split ","} # Ex13+

                .PARAMETER Roles
                Array of msExchCurrentServerRoles 'role' integers to be filtered against (2|4|16|20|32|36|38|54|64|16385|16439)[-Roles @(38,16385)]
                .PARAMETER RoleNames
                Array of Server 'Role' name strings to be filtered against (MBX|CAS|HUB|UM|MBX|EDGE)[-RoleNames 'HUB','CAS']
                .PARAMETER Server
                Array of Server name strings to be filtered against[-Server 'SERVER1','SERVER2']
                .PARAMETER SiteName
                Name of specific AD SiteName to be searched for ExchangeServers (defaults to global variable `$TenOrg_ADSiteDefaultName if present)[-SiteName 'SITENAME']
                .PARAMETER TenOrg
                Tenant Tag (3-letter abbrebiation - defaults to variable `$global:o365_TenOrgDefault if present)[-TenOrg 'XYZ']
                .PARAMETER NoPing
                Switch to suppress default 'pingable' test (e.g. returns all matches, no testing)[-NoPing]
                .INPUTS
                None. Does not accepted piped input.(.NET types, can add description)
                .OUTPUTS
                None. Returns no objects or output (.NET types)
                System.Boolean
                [| get-member the output to see what .NET obj TypeName is returned, to use here]
                System.Array of System.Object's
                .EXAMPLE
                PS> If(!($ExchangeServer)){$ExchangeServer = (get-ADExchangeServerTDO| ?{$_.RoleNames -contains 'CAS' -OR $_.RoleNames -contains 'HUB' -AND ($_.FQDN -match "^SITECODE") } | Get-Random ).FQDN
                Return a random Hub Cas Role server in the local Site with a fqdn beginning SITECODE
                .EXAMPLE
                PS> $localADExchserver = get-ADExchangeServerTDO -Names $env:computername -SiteName ([System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.ActiveDirectorySite]::GetComputerSite().name)
                Demo, if run from an Exchange server, return summary details about the local server (-SiteName isn't required, is default imputed from local server's Site, but demos explicit spec for remote sites)
                .EXAMPLE
                PS> $regex = '(' + [regex]($ADSiteCodeUK,$ADSiteCodeAU -join "|") + ')'
                PS> switch -regex ($($env:computername).substring(0,3)){
                PS>    "$($ADSiteCodeUS)" {$tExRole=36 } ;
                PS>    "$($regex)" {$tExRole= 38 }  default { write-error "$((get-date).ToString('HH:mm:ss')):UNRECOGNIZED SERVER PREFIX!."; } ;
                PS> } ;
                PS> $exhubcas = (get-ADExchangeServerTDO |?{($_.roles -eq $tExRole) -AND ($_.FQDN -match "$($env:computername.substring(0,3)).*")} | Get-Random ).FQDN ;
                Use a switch block to select different role combo targets for a given server fqdn prefix string.
                .EXAMPLE
                PS> $ExchangeServer = get-ADExchangeServerTDO | ?{$_.Roles -match '(4|20|32|36|38|16385|16439)'} | select -expand fqdn | get-random ; 
                Another/Older approach filtering on the Roles integer (targeting combos with Hub or CAS in the mix)
                .EXAMPLE
                PS> $ret = get-ADExchangeServerTDO -Roles @(4,20,32,36,38,16385,16439) -verbose 
                Demo use of the -Roles param, feeding it an array of Role integer values to be filtered against. In this case, the Role integers that include a CAS or HUB role.
                .EXAMPLE
                PS> $ret = get-ADExchangeServerTDO -RoleNames 'HUB','CAS' -verbose ;
                Demo use of the -RoleNames param, feeding it the array 'HUB','CAS' Role name strings to be filtered against
                PS> $ret = get-ADExchangeServerTDO -Names 'SERVERName' -verbose ;
                Demo use of the -RoleNames param, feeding it the array 'HUB','CAS' Role name strings to be filtered against
                .EXAMPLE
                PS> $ExchangeServer = get-ADExchangeServerTDO | sort version,roles,name | ?{$_.rolenames -contains 'CAS'}  | select -last 1 | select -expand fqdn ;
                Demo post sorting & filtering, to deliver a rule-based predictable pattern for server selection: 
                Above will always pick the highest Version, 'CAS' RoleName containing, alphabetically last server name (that is pingable). 
                And should stick to that pattern, until the servers installed change, when it will shift to the next predictable box.
                .EXAMPLE
                PS> $ExOPServer = get-ADExchangeServerTDO -Name LYNMS650 -SiteName Lyndale
                PS> if([double]$ExVersNum = [regex]::match($ExOPServer.version,"Version\s(\d+\.\d+)\s\(Build\s(\d+\.\d+)\)").groups[1].value){
                PS>     switch -regex ([string]$ExVersNum) {
                PS>         '15\.2' { $isEx2019 = $true ; $ExVers = 'Ex2019' }
                PS>         '15\.1' { $isEx2016 = $true ; $ExVers = 'Ex2016'}
                PS>         '15\.0' { $isEx2013 = $true ; $ExVers = 'Ex2013'}
                PS>         '14\..*' { $isEx2010 = $true ; $ExVers = 'Ex2010'}
                PS>         '8\..*' { $isEx2007 = $true ; $ExVers = 'Ex2007'}
                PS>         '6\.5' { $isEx2003 = $true ; $ExVers = 'Ex2003'}
                PS>         '6|6\.0' {$isEx2000 = $true ; $ExVers = 'Ex2000'} ;
                PS>         default {
                PS>             $smsg = "UNRECOGNIZED ExchangeServer.AdminDisplayVersion.Major.Minor string:$($ExOPServer.version)! ABORTING!" ;
                PS>             write-WARNING "$((get-date).ToString('HH:mm:ss')):$($smsg)" ;
                PS>         }
                PS>     } ; 
                PS> }else {
                PS>     $smsg = "UNABLE TO RESOLVE `$ExVersNum from `$ExOPServer.version:$($ExOPServer.version)!" ;

                PS>     break ; 
                PS> } ; 
                Demo of parsing the returned Version property, into the proper Exchange Server revision.

    REVISIONS   :
    * 1:30 PM 9/5/2024 added  update-SecurityProtocolTDO() SB to begin
    # 3:18 PM 5/18/2021 somehow lost $credOpTORSID, so flipped lost default $credOPTor -> $credTORSID
    # 11:20 AM 4/21/2021 fixed/suppressed noisy verbose calls
    # 8:34 AM 3/31/2021 added verbose suppress to all import-mods; flipped import-psess & import-mod to splats (cleaner) ; line-wrapped longer post-filters for legib
    * 8:30 AM 10/22/2020 ren'd $TentantTag -> $TenOrg, swapped looping meta resolve with 1-liner approach ; added AcceptedDom caching to the middle status test (suppress one more get-exoaccepteddomain call if possible), replaced all $Meta.value with the $TenOrg version
    * 12:56 PM 10/15/2020 converted connect-exo to Ex2010, adding onprem validation
    .DESCRIPTION
    Connect-Ex2010XO - Establish PSS to Ex2010, with multi-org support & validation
    .PARAMETER  ExchangeServer
    On Prem Exch server to Remote to
    .PARAMETER  ExAdmin
    Use exadmin IIS WebPool for remote EMS[-ExAdmin]
    .PARAMETER  Credential
    Credential object
    .PARAMETER  showDebug
    Debugging Flag [-showDebug]
    .INPUTS
    None. Does not accepted piped input.
    .OUTPUTS
    None. Returns no objects or output.
    .EXAMPLE
    Connect-Ex2010XO
    Connect using defaults, and leverage any pre-set $global:credo365TORSID variable
    .EXAMPLE
    connect-exo -CommandPrefix exo -credential (Get-Credential -credential s-todd.kadrie@torolab.com)  ;
    Connect an explicit credential, and use 'exolab' as the cmdlet prefix
    .EXAMPLE
    $cred = get-credential -credential $o365_Torolab_SIDUpn ;
    connect-exo -credential $cred ;
    Pass in a prefab credential object (useful for auto-shifting to MFA - the function will autoresolve MFA reqs based on the cred domain)

        .SYNOPSIS
        Connect-ExchangeServerTDO.ps1 - Dependancy-less Function that, fed an Exchange server name, or AD SiteName, and optional RoleNames array, 
        will obtain a list of Exchange servers from AD (in the specified scope), and then run the list attempting to PowershellREmote (REMS) connect to each server, 
        stopping at the first successful connection.
        .NOTES
        REVISIONS
        * 3:48 PM 10/21/2025 updated CBH for post-import tests on call
        * 3:58 PM 5/14/2025 restored prior dropped earlier rev history (routinely trim for psparamt inclu)
        * 10;07 am 4/30/2025 fixed borked edge conn, typo, and rev logic for Ex & role detection in raw PS - lacks evaris for exchange (EMS/REMS only), so leverage reg & stock install loc hunting to discover setup.exe for vers & role confirm).
        * 2:46 PM 4/22/2025 add: -Version (default to Ex2010), and postfiltered returned ExchangeServers on version. If no -Version, sort on newest Version, then name, -descending.
        * 4:25 PM 1/15/2025 seems to work at this point, move to rebuild
        * 4:49 PM 1/9/2025 reworked connect-exchangeserverTdo() to actually use the credentials passed in, and 
        added the missing import-module $PSS, to _connect-ExOP, to make the session actually functional 
        for running cmds, wo popping cred prompts. 
        * 12:24 PM 12/4/2024 removed bracket bnr echos around _connect-ExOP
        * 3:54 PM 11/26/2024 integrated back TLS fixes, and ExVersNum flip from June; syncd dbg & vx10 copies.
        * 12:57 PM 6/11/2024 Validated, Ex2010 & Ex2019, hub, mail & edge roles: tested ☑️ on CMW mail role (Curly); and Jumpbox; 
        copied in CBH from repo copy, which has been updated/debugged compat on CMW Edge 
        includes local snapin detect & load for edge role (simplest EMS load option for Edge role, from David Paulson's original code; no longer published with Ex2010 compat)
        * 1:30 PM 9/5/2024 added  update-SecurityProtocolTDO() SB to begin
        * 12:49 PM 6/21/2024 flipped PSS Name to Exchange$($ExchVers[dd])
        * 11:28 AM 5/30/2024 fixed failure to recognize existing functional PSSession; Made substantial update in logic, validate works fine with other orgs, and in our local orgs.
        * 4:02 PM 8/28/2023 debuged, updated CBH, renamed connect-ExchangeSErver -> Connect-ExchangeServerTDO (avoid name clashes, pretty common verb-noun combo).
        * 12:36 PM 8/24/2023 init

                    REVISIONS
                    * 3:57 PM 11/26/2024 updated simple write-host,write-verbose with full pswlt support;  syncd dbg & vx10 copies.
                    * 12:57 PM 6/11/2024 Validated, Ex2010 & Ex2019, hub, mail & edge roles: tested ☑️ on CMW mail role (Curly); and Jumpbox; copied in CBH from repo copy, which has been updated/debugged compat on CMW Edge 
                    * 2:05 PM 8/28/2023 REN -> Get-ExchangeServerInSite -> get-ADExchangeServerTDO (aliased orig); to better steer profile-level options - including in cmw org, added -TenOrg, and default Site to constructed vari, targeting new profile $XXX_ADSiteDefault vari; Defaulted -Roles to HUB,CAS as well.
                    * 3:42 PM 8/24/2023 spliced together combo of my long-standing, and some of the interesting ideas BF's version had. Functional prod:
                        - completely removed ActiveDirectory module dependancies from BF's code, and reimplemented in raw ADSI calls. Makes it fully portable, even into areas like Edge DMZ roles, where ADMS would never be installed.

                    * 3:17 PM 8/23/2023 post Edge testing: some logic fixes; add: -Names param to filter on server names; -Site & supporting code, to permit lookup against sites *not* local to the local machine (and bypass lookup on the local machine) ; 
                        ren $Ex10siteDN -> $ExOPsiteDN; ren $Ex10configNC -> $ExopconfigNC
                    * 1:03 PM 8/22/2023 minor cleanup
                    * 10:31 AM 4/7/2023 added CBH expl of postfilter/sorting to draw predictable pattern 
                    * 4:36 PM 4/6/2023 validated Psv51 & Psv20 and Ex10 & 16; added -Roles & -RoleNames params, to perform role filtering within the function (rather than as an external post-filter step). 
                    For backward-compat retain historical output field 'Roles' as the msexchcurrentserverroles summary integer; 
                    use RoleNames as the text role array; 
                        updated for psv2 compat: flipped hash key lookups into properties, found capizliation differences, (psv2 2was all lower case, wouldn't match); 
                    flipped the [pscustomobject] with new... psobj, still psv2 doesn't index the hash keys ; updated for Ex13+: Added  16  "UM"; 20  "CAS, UM"; 54  "MBX" Ex13+ ; 16385 "CAS" Ex13+ ; 16439 "CAS, HUB, MBX" Ex13+
                    Also hybrided in some good ideas from SammyKrosoft's Get-SKExchangeServers.psm1 
                    (emits Version, Site, low lvl Roles # array, and an array of Roles, for post-filtering); 
                    # 11:20 AM 4/21/2021 fixed/suppressed noisy verbose calls
                    * 12:08 PM 5/15/2020 fixed vpn issue: Try/Catch'd around recently failing $ADSite::GetComputerSite().GetDirectoryEntry().distinguishedName qry
                    * 11:22 AM 3/13/2020 Get-ExchangeServerInSite added a ping-test, to only return matches that are pingable, added -NoPing param, to permit (faster) untested bypass
                    * 6:59 PM 1/15/2020 cleanup
                    # 10:03 AM 11/16/2018 Get-ExchangeServerInSite:can't do AD-related functions when not AD authentictaed (home, pre-vpn connect). Added if/then test on status and abort balance when false.
                    * 11/18/18 BF's posted rev
                    # 12:10 PM 8/1/2017 updated example code at bottom, to accommodate variant sites
                    # 11:28 AM 3/31/2016 validated that latest round of updates are still functional
                    #1:58 PM 9/3/2015 - added pshelp and some docs
                    #April 12, 2010 - web version
                    .DESCRIPTION
                    get-ADExchangeServerTDO.ps1 - Returns Exchangeserver summary(s) from AD records

                    Hybrided together ideas from Brian Farnsworth's blog post
                    [PowerShell - ActiveDirectory and Exchange Servers – CodeAndKeep.Com – Code and keep calm...](https://codeandkeep.com/PowerShell-ActiveDirectory-Exchange-Part1/)
                    ... with much older concepts from  Sammy Krosoft, and much earlier Mike Pfeiffer. 

                    - Subbed in MP's use of ADSI for ActiveDirectory Ps mod cmds - it's much more dependancy-free; doesn't require explicit install of the AD ps module
                    ADSI support is built into windows.
                    - spliced over my addition of Roles, RoleNames, Name & NoTest params, for prefiltering and suppressing testing.


                    [briansworth · GitHub](https://github.com/briansworth)

                    Uses an ADSI DirectorySearcher to search the current Active Directory site for Exchange on-prem servers.
                            Intent is to discover connection points for Powershell, wo the need to preload/pre-connect to Exchange.

                            But, as a non-Exchange-Management-Shell-dependant info source on Exchange Server configs, it can be used before connection, with solely AD-available data, to check configuration spes on the subject server(s). 

                            For example, this query will return sufficient data under Version to indicate which revision of Exchange is in use:


                            Returned object (in array):
                            Site      : {ADSITENAME}
                            Roles     : {64}
                            Version   : {Version 15.1 (Build 32375.7)}
                            Name      : SERVERNAME
                            RoleNames : EDGE
                            FQDN      : SERVERNAME.DOMAIN.TLD

                            ... includes the post-filterable Role property ($_.Role -contains 'CAS') which reflects the following
                            installed-roles ('msExchCurrentServerRoles') on the discovered servers

                    Demo use of the -Roles param, feeding it an array of Role integer values to be filtered against. In this case, the Role integers that include a CAS or HUB role.

                    PS> $ret = get-ADExchangeServerTDO -RoleNames 'HUB','CAS' -verbose ;
                    Demo use of the -RoleNames param, feeding it the array 'HUB','CAS' Role name strings to be filtered against

                    Demo post sorting & filtering, to deliver a rule-based predictable pattern for server selection: 
                    Above will always pick the highest Version, 'CAS' RoleName containing, alphabetically last server name (that is pingable). 
                    And should stick to that pattern, until the servers installed change, when it will shift to the next predictable box.

                    Array of Domain controller names in target site/domain to exclude from returns (work around temp access issues)
                    .PARAMETER ServerPrefix
                    Prefix string to filter for, in returns (e.g. 'ABC' would only return DCs with name starting 'ABC')

        REVISIONS
        * 2:47 PM 12/2/2025 💡 updated the CBH demo to test for missing cmdlet, before doing reimport (conditional on actual fail; 
            imports are needed when this is called out of the .psm1 by another freestanding .ps1; 
            tends to work fine wo remedial ip from funcs inside the psm1). Tested in latest set-exLicense.
        * 4:13 PM 10/7/2025 updated CBH non-func $idfqdn for $env:computername in pss test ; 
            for demo of new remedial call import code; code to detect preexisting pssessions, and skip rexec redund, also to remove those as they accumulate; 
        * 5:12 PM 8/16/2025 connect-XopLocalManagementShell():Edge lacks RemoteExchange.ps1, added regkey edge test to exempt test for the file (was causing premature throw).
        * 10:45 AM 8/6/2025 added write-myOutput|Warning|Verbose support (for xopBuildLibrary/install-Exchange15.ps1 compat)
        * 9:40 AM 8/5/2025 add pop missing $env:ExchangeInstallPath; confirm dep RemoteExchange.ps1 is accessible
        * 8:59 AM 7/30/2025 add CBH xmpl, test cmdlet trigger
        * 3:36 PM 7/24/2025 defaulted ExVers Ex2016
        * 1:13 PM 7/14/2025 ADDED -identity; updated code from test-xopLocal
        * 1:08 PM 3/27/2025 added min items to make it a functional Adv Function (w verbose support etc)
        * 9:09 AM 3/26/2025 added ipsn post connect-ExchangeServer() call (wasn't including import/non-functional [headscratch]); beyond that, used wo issues on 1st of the Ex16 builds
        * 8/12/2020 Pietro Ciaccio's PSG-posted ExchangePowerShell module, v0.11.0
        .DESCRIPTION
        connect-XopLocalManagementShell - Detects *local* machine has Exchange Server installed, the role (Mailbox v Edge); resolves & configs dependant Env Varis; configures and loads local Exchange Management Shell (EMS) connection into the server. Then returns the PSSession object to the pipeline.
        Functions as a ground-up autodiscovery & configure EMS load, without pre-existing Exchange Server EMS shortcut. 
        .OUTPUT
        System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.PSSession (for successful non-Edge Exchange Server role connection)
        System.Management.Automation.PSModuleInfo (for  successful Edge Exchange Server role connection)
        .EXAMPLE
        PS> if(connect-XopLocalManagementShell){ write-host -foregroundcolor green "Connected" } else { write-warning "NOT CONNECTED!"} ;
        Simple test - returns session on connection.

            .DESCRIPTION
            Convert-xopAdminDisplayVersionTDO - Convert Exchange Server AdminDisplayVersion 'Version [major].[minor] (Build [buildmajor].[buildminor])' (as returned by EMS get-ExchangeServer) to equiv Semantic Version (major.minor.buildmajor.build.minor)

            Simple job: 
            - the AdminDisplayVersion string: 'Version 15.1 (Build 2507.6)'
            ...represents following SemVersion components: 
                'Version [major].[minor] (Build [buildMajor].[buildMinor])'
            ... which just need to be regex parsed and lined up into equiv semversion:
                [major].[minor].[buildMajor].[buildMinor]
                == 15.1.2507.6

            .PARAMETER AdminDisplayVersion
            .INPUTS
            Accepts piped input.
            .OUTPUTS
            System.Version Semantic Version object
            .EXAMPLE
            PS> $VersionNum = Convert-xopAdminDisplayVersionTDO -AdminDisplayVersion ((get-exchangeserver Server1).AdminDisplayVersion) ; 
            PS> $VersionNum ;

    * 10:47 AM 7/11/2024 cleared debugging NoSuch etc meta tests
    * 1:34 PM 6/21/2024 ren $Global:E10Sess -> $Global:EXOPSess ; add: prereq checks, and $isBased support, to devert into most connect-exchangeServerTDO, get-ADExchangeServerTDO 100% generic fall back support; sketched in Ex2013 disconnect support
    # 11:12 AM 10/25/2021 added trailing null $Global:E10Sess  (to avoid false conn detects on that test)
    # 9:44 AM 7/27/2021 add -PsTitleBar EMS[ctl] support by dyn gathering range of all 1st & last $Meta.Name[0,2] values
    # 11:20 AM 4/21/2021 fixed/suppressed noisy verbose calls
    * 1:14 PM 3/1/2021 added color reset
    * 4:13 PM 10/22/2020 added pretest of $Global:*'s before running at remove-module (suppresses errors)

        REVISIONS
        * 10;05 am 4/30/2025 fixed code for Edge role in raw PS, missing evaris for Ex: added discovery from reg & stock file system dirs for version etc.
        * 3:57 PM 11/26/2024 updated simple write-host,write-verbose with full pswlt support;  syncd dbg & vx10 copies.
        * 12:57 PM 6/11/2024 Validated, Ex2010 & Ex2019, hub, mail & edge roles: tested ☑️ on CMW mail role (Curly); and Jumpbox; copied in CBH from repo copy, which has been updated/debugged compat on CMW Edge 
        * 2:05 PM 8/28/2023 REN -> Get-ExchangeServerInSite -> get-ADExchangeServerTDO (aliased orig); to better steer profile-level options - including in cmw org, added -TenOrg, and default Site to constructed vari, targeting new profile $XXX_ADSiteDefault vari; Defaulted -Roles to HUB,CAS as well.
        * 3:42 PM 8/24/2023 spliced together combo of my long-standing, and some of the interesting ideas BF's version had. Functional prod:
            - completely removed ActiveDirectory module dependancies from BF's code, and reimplemented in raw ADSI calls. Makes it fully portable, even into areas like Edge DMZ roles, where ADMS would never be installed.

        * 3:17 PM 8/23/2023 post Edge testing: some logic fixes; add: -Names param to filter on server names; -Site & supporting code, to permit lookup against sites *not* local to the local machine (and bypass lookup on the local machine) ; 
            ren $Ex10siteDN -> $ExOPsiteDN; ren $Ex10configNC -> $ExopconfigNC
        * 1:03 PM 8/22/2023 minor cleanup
        * 10:31 AM 4/7/2023 added CBH expl of postfilter/sorting to draw predictable pattern 
        * 4:36 PM 4/6/2023 validated Psv51 & Psv20 and Ex10 & 16; added -Roles & -RoleNames params, to perform role filtering within the function (rather than as an external post-filter step). 
        For backward-compat retain historical output field 'Roles' as the msexchcurrentserverroles summary integer; 
        use RoleNames as the text role array; 
            updated for psv2 compat: flipped hash key lookups into properties, found capizliation differences, (psv2 2was all lower case, wouldn't match); 
        flipped the [pscustomobject] with new... psobj, still psv2 doesn't index the hash keys ; updated for Ex13+: Added  16  "UM"; 20  "CAS, UM"; 54  "MBX" Ex13+ ; 16385 "CAS" Ex13+ ; 16439 "CAS, HUB, MBX" Ex13+
        Also hybrided in some good ideas from SammyKrosoft's Get-SKExchangeServers.psm1 
        (emits Version, Site, low lvl Roles # array, and an array of Roles, for post-filtering); 
        # 11:20 AM 4/21/2021 fixed/suppressed noisy verbose calls
        * 12:08 PM 5/15/2020 fixed vpn issue: Try/Catch'd around recently failing $ADSite::GetComputerSite().GetDirectoryEntry().distinguishedName qry
        * 11:22 AM 3/13/2020 Get-ExchangeServerInSite added a ping-test, to only return matches that are pingable, added -NoPing param, to permit (faster) untested bypass
        * 6:59 PM 1/15/2020 cleanup
        # 10:03 AM 11/16/2018 Get-ExchangeServerInSite:can't do AD-related functions when not AD authentictaed (home, pre-vpn connect). Added if/then test on status and abort balance when false.
        * 11/18/18 BF's posted rev
        # 12:10 PM 8/1/2017 updated example code at bottom, to accommodate variant sites
        # 11:28 AM 3/31/2016 validated that latest round of updates are still functional
        #1:58 PM 9/3/2015 - added pshelp and some docs
        #April 12, 2010 - web version
        .DESCRIPTION
        get-ADExchangeServerTDO.ps1 - Returns Exchangeserver summary(s) from AD records

        Hybrided together ideas from Brian Farnsworth's blog post
        [PowerShell - ActiveDirectory and Exchange Servers – CodeAndKeep.Com – Code and keep calm...](https://codeandkeep.com/PowerShell-ActiveDirectory-Exchange-Part1/)
        ... with much older concepts from  Sammy Krosoft, and much earlier Mike Pfeiffer. 

        - Subbed in MP's use of ADSI for ActiveDirectory Ps mod cmds - it's much more dependancy-free; doesn't require explicit install of the AD ps module
        ADSI support is built into windows.
        - spliced over my addition of Roles, RoleNames, Name & NoTest params, for prefiltering and suppressing testing.


        [briansworth · GitHub](https://github.com/briansworth)

        Uses an ADSI DirectorySearcher to search the current Active Directory site for Exchange on-prem servers.
                Intent is to discover connection points for Powershell, wo the need to preload/pre-connect to Exchange.

                But, as a non-Exchange-Management-Shell-dependant info source on Exchange Server configs, it can be used before connection, with solely AD-available data, to check configuration spes on the subject server(s). 

                For example, this query will return sufficient data under Version to indicate which revision of Exchange is in use:


                Returned object (in array):
                Site      : {ADSITENAME}
                Roles     : {64}
                Version   : {Version 15.1 (Build 32375.7)}
                Name      : SERVERNAME
                RoleNames : EDGE
                FQDN      : SERVERNAME.DOMAIN.TLD

                ... includes the post-filterable Role property ($_.Role -contains 'CAS') which reflects the following
                installed-roles ('msExchCurrentServerRoles') on the discovered servers
                    2   {"MBX"} # Ex10
                    4   {"CAS"}
                    16  {"UM"}
                    20  {"CAS, UM" -split ","} # 
                    32  {"HUB"}
                    36  {"CAS, HUB" -split ","}
                    38  {"CAS, HUB, MBX" -split ","}
                    54  {"MBX"} # Ex13+
                    64  {"EDGE"}
                    16385   {"CAS"} # Ex13+
                    16439   {"CAS, HUB, MBX"  -split ","} # Ex13+
        .PARAMETER Roles
        Array of msExchCurrentServerRoles 'role' integers to be filtered against (2|4|16|20|32|36|38|54|64|16385|16439)[-Roles @(38,16385)]
        .PARAMETER RoleNames
        Array of Server 'Role' name strings to be filtered against (MBX|CAS|HUB|UM|MBX|EDGE)[-RoleNames 'HUB','CAS']
        .PARAMETER Server
        Array of Server name strings to be filtered against[-Server 'SERVER1','SERVER2']
        .PARAMETER SiteName
        Name of specific AD SiteName to be searched for ExchangeServers (defaults to global variable `$TenOrg_ADSiteDefaultName if present)[-SiteName 'SITENAME']
        .PARAMETER TenOrg
        Tenant Tag (3-letter abbrebiation - defaults to variable `$global:o365_TenOrgDefault if present)[-TenOrg 'XYZ']
        .PARAMETER NoPing
        Switch to suppress default 'pingable' test (e.g. returns all matches, no testing)[-NoPing]
        .INPUTS
        None. Does not accepted piped input.(.NET types, can add description)
        .OUTPUTS
        None. Returns no objects or output (.NET types)
        System.Boolean
        [| get-member the output to see what .NET obj TypeName is returned, to use here]
        System.Array of System.Object's
        .EXAMPLE
        PS> If(!($ExchangeServer)){$ExchangeServer = (get-ADExchangeServerTDO| ?{$_.RoleNames -contains 'CAS' -OR $_.RoleNames -contains 'HUB' -AND ($_.FQDN -match "^SITECODE") } | Get-Random ).FQDN
        Return a random Hub Cas Role server in the local Site with a fqdn beginning SITECODE
        .EXAMPLE
        PS> $localADExchserver = get-ADExchangeServerTDO -Names $env:computername -SiteName ([System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.ActiveDirectorySite]::GetComputerSite().name)
        Demo, if run from an Exchange server, return summary details about the local server (-SiteName isn't required, is default imputed from local server's Site, but demos explicit spec for remote sites)
        .EXAMPLE
        PS> $regex = '(' + [regex]($ADSiteCodeUK,$ADSiteCodeAU -join "|") + ')'
        PS> switch -regex ($($env:computername).substring(0,3)){
        PS>    "$($ADSiteCodeUS)" {$tExRole=36 } ;
        PS>    "$($regex)" {$tExRole= 38 }  default { write-error "$((get-date).ToString('HH:mm:ss')):UNRECOGNIZED SERVER PREFIX!."; } ;
        PS> } ;
        PS> $exhubcas = (get-ADExchangeServerTDO |?{($_.roles -eq $tExRole) -AND ($_.FQDN -match "$($env:computername.substring(0,3)).*")} | Get-Random ).FQDN ;
        Use a switch block to select different role combo targets for a given server fqdn prefix string.
        .EXAMPLE
        PS> $ExchangeServer = get-ADExchangeServerTDO | ?{$_.Roles -match '(4|20|32|36|38|16385|16439)'} | select -expand fqdn | get-random ; 
        Another/Older approach filtering on the Roles integer (targeting combos with Hub or CAS in the mix)
        .EXAMPLE
        PS> $ret = get-ADExchangeServerTDO -Roles @(4,20,32,36,38,16385,16439) -verbose 
        Demo use of the -Roles param, feeding it an array of Role integer values to be filtered against. In this case, the Role integers that include a CAS or HUB role.
        .EXAMPLE
        PS> $ret = get-ADExchangeServerTDO -RoleNames 'HUB','CAS' -verbose ;
        Demo use of the -RoleNames param, feeding it the array 'HUB','CAS' Role name strings to be filtered against
        PS> $ret = get-ADExchangeServerTDO -Names 'SERVERName' -verbose ;
        Demo use of the -RoleNames param, feeding it the array 'HUB','CAS' Role name strings to be filtered against
        .EXAMPLE
        PS> $ExchangeServer = get-ADExchangeServerTDO | sort version,roles,name | ?{$_.rolenames -contains 'CAS'}  | select -last 1 | select -expand fqdn ;
        Demo post sorting & filtering, to deliver a rule-based predictable pattern for server selection: 
        Above will always pick the highest Version, 'CAS' RoleName containing, alphabetically last server name (that is pingable). 
        And should stick to that pattern, until the servers installed change, when it will shift to the next predictable box.
        .EXAMPLE
        PS> $ExOPServer = get-ADExchangeServerTDO -Name LYNMS650 -SiteName Lyndale
        PS> if([double]$ExVersNum = [regex]::match($ExOPServer.version,"Version\s(\d+\.\d+)\s\(Build\s(\d+\.\d+)\)").groups[1].value){
        PS>     switch -regex ([string]$ExVersNum) {
        PS>         '15\.2' { $isEx2019 = $true ; $ExVers = 'Ex2019' }
        PS>         '15\.1' { $isEx2016 = $true ; $ExVers = 'Ex2016'}
        PS>         '15\.0' { $isEx2013 = $true ; $ExVers = 'Ex2013'}
        PS>         '14\..*' { $isEx2010 = $true ; $ExVers = 'Ex2010'}
        PS>         '8\..*' { $isEx2007 = $true ; $ExVers = 'Ex2007'}
        PS>         '6\.5' { $isEx2003 = $true ; $ExVers = 'Ex2003'}
        PS>         '6|6\.0' {$isEx2000 = $true ; $ExVers = 'Ex2000'} ;
        PS>         default {
        PS>             $smsg = "UNRECOGNIZED ExchangeServer.AdminDisplayVersion.Major.Minor string:$($ExOPServer.version)! ABORTING!" ;
        PS>             write-WARNING "$((get-date).ToString('HH:mm:ss')):$($smsg)" ;
        PS>         }
        PS>     } ; 
        PS> }else {
        PS>     $smsg = "UNABLE TO RESOLVE `$ExVersNum from `$ExOPServer.version:$($ExOPServer.version)!" ; 
        PS>     write-WARNING "$((get-date).ToString('HH:mm:ss')):$($smsg)"  ; 
        PS>     throw $smsg ; 
        PS>     break ; 
        PS> } ; 
        Demo of parsing the returned Version property, into the proper Exchange Server revision.

    .DESCRIPTION
    get-DAGDatabaseCopyStatus.ps1 - Retrieve MailboxDatabaseCopyStatus for an entire DatabaseAvailabilityGroup
    .PARAMETER  users
    Array of user descriptors: displayname, emailaddress, UPN, samaccountname (checks clipboard where unspecified)
    .PARAMETER ADDisabledOnly
    Switch to exclude users solely on ADUser.disabled (not Disabled OU presense), or with that have the ADUser below an OU matching '*OU=(Disabled|TERMedUsers)'  [-ADDisabledOnly]
    .PARAMETER useEXOv2
    Use EXOv2 (ExchangeOnlineManagement) over basic auth legacy connection [-useEXOv2]
    .INPUTS
    None. Does not accepted piped input.(.NET types, can add description)
    .OUTPUTS
    Returns a System.Object[] object to pipeline, with subsets of processed users as 'Enabled' (ADUser.enabled),'Disabled', and 'Contacts' properties.
    .EXAMPLE
    PS> $rpt = get-DAGDatabaseCopyStatus -users 'username1','user2@domain.com','[distinguishedname]' ;
    PS> $rpt | export-csv -nottype ".\pathto\usersummaries-$(get-date -format 'yyyyMMdd-HHmmtt').csv" ;
    Processes local/remotemailbox & ADUser details on three specified users (alias,email address, DN). Summaries are returned to pipeline, and assigned to the $rpt variable, which is then exported to csv.
    .EXAMPLE
    PS> $rpt = get-DAGDatabaseCopyStatus -users 'username1','user2@domain.com','[distinguishedname]' -ADDisabledOnly ;
    PS> $rpt | export-csv -nottype ".\pathto\usersummaries-ENABLEDUSERS-$(get-date -format 'yyyyMMdd-HHmmtt').csv" ;
    Processes local/remotemailbox & ADUser details on three specified users (alias,email address, DN).
    And allocate as 'Disabled', accounts that are *solely* ADUser.disabled
    (e.g. considers users below OU's with names like 'OU=Disabled*' as 'Enabled' users),
    and then exports to csv.
    .EXAMPLE
    $rpt = get-DAGDatabaseCopyStatus -users 'username1','user2@domain.com','[distinguishedname]' ;
    $rpt.enabled | export-csv -nottype ".\pathto\usersummaries-ENABLEDUSERS-$(get-date -format 'yyyyMMdd-HHmmtt').csv" ;
    Process specified identifiers, and export solely the 'Enabled' users returned to csv.

        get-IISLocalBoundCertifcateTDO - Retrieves the certificate bound to the IIS Default Website (also handy for independantly verifyinig Exchange Service bindings, when get-exchangecertificate is mangled by Exchange Auth cert expiration). 
        
        Driven by get-exchangecertificate fundemental on-install break, when Nov2023 SU patching packet signing mandates break any time the Exchange Auth certificate is non-functional
        Unfortunately, fixing the issue requires rerunning Hybrid Configuration Wizard as part of the process (Change approval requiremment PITA).
        So this is one way to commandline confirm Exchange Cert Service binding, without a functional get-exchangecertificate return (or using EAC web site).

    REVISIONS
    * 10:28 AM 9/11/2025 found it writing epcsv to modules install dir: enviro_discover block & resolve-EnvironmentTDO() to latest parammt vers. Now exports properly to d:\scripts\ on jb.
    * 10;23 am 4/30/2025 - get-ADExchangeServerTDO: * 10;05 am 4/30/2025 fixed code for Edge role in raw PS, missing evaris for Ex: added discovery from reg & stock file system dirs for version etc.
        - Connect-ExchangeServerTDO: * 10;07 am 4/30/2025 fixed borked edge conn, typo, and rev logic for Ex & role detection in raw PS - lacks evaris for exchange (EMS/REMS only), so leverage reg & stock install loc hunting to discover setup.exe for vers & role confirm).
        - start-log: made Tag cleanup conditional (on funcs avail; legacy of bringing full start-log into the mix).
    * 1:35 PM 4/29/2025: added resolve-NetworkLocalTDO() (for vnet); 
        - Initialize-xopEventIDTable(): * 2;58 pm 4/28/2025 Updated table again, and found Ex2016/19 eventid specifications online, added. Did find that 
            the online doc doesn't document the edge SendExternal event id (added below, manually).      
        - ENCODED_CONTANTS block: added eval'd varis: $isLocalExchangeServer, $ByPassLocalExchangeServerTest, $IsEdgeTransport
        - new NETWORK_INFO block: $netsettings = resolve-NetworkLocalTDO() ;
        - new $isNonDomainServer test, $isLocalExchangeServer (transport svc & regkey), $IsEdgeTransport (regkey test)
        - revised $TenOrg forced resolution, to leverage DNS A fqdn suffix steering (collected via new resolve-NetworkLocalTDO())
        - UseOPAD: skip AD load, $useForestWide, $objforest, $forestdom, $domaincontroller & get-GCFast(), if $isNonDomainServer
        - added block that tests if($IsEdgeTransport -AND $psise) and warns likely AccessDenied's from ex commands (works fine in EMS outside of ise)
        - revised $OrgTag resolution, to detect Edge 'First Org' orgname, and substitute in $($TenOrg)edge log name tagging
        - stripped back Sender array expansion (ported from EXO, which supports mults): gmtl *doesnt* support [string[]]$Sender, throws error.
        - validated on TTC Ex10 (did CMW hubs & edge below)
    * 3:12 pm 4/28/2025 Noted, get-OrgConfig returns 'First Org... on edge, so coded in TenOrgedge as OrgTag in that niched case (was coming back 'O_FO' ; 
        extensive debugging updates in the services_control BP block, and detection and handling of TenOrg around non-dom-joined edge role machine; 
            Still having issues in psie debugging: throws localizaiton error - appears due to the EMS connection; works fine in raw EMS console on edge. 
            work either way on non-edge systems. Fine, but you can't step-debug it in ise on edge boxes
             - you can, but you can't get the get-messagetrackinglog command to exec properrly, throws Access Denied trying to access the logs
             errors correspond to those reported by folks trying to centralize edge tracking, from remote hosts. So it's definitely an REMS v EMS issue.
    * 4:25 PM 4/24/2025 validated TOR & full func verif CMW, after: Svcs_conn: added pretest for version in connect-exchangeserverTDO, splat (suppress dupe add error), only necc if both an explicit vers is specd & its on CMW
        - also added OrgName abbreviated to the exports, to differentiate sources
    * 8:01 PM 4/23/2025 add: Version, to match connect-ExchangeServerTDO() param, -DetailLimit for config of detailed outptut sizes; 
        # service_conn block: added $ExopVers, which defers to local $Version, if populated
        # also completely skips all the verb-x10 functions, when $TenOrg -eq CMW (no mod installs on their servers, this runs freestanding, self-contained only, no central va support
        - fixed bug/misplacement of most recent echo; restricted detail outputs to select -last $DetailLimit msgs; 
        - reworked Failed reporting; added an explicit 'other', for anything not covred by the existing targeted filtering.
        - substantially expanded Defer coverage: with volume defered in SAP tracks into other site, needed way to confirm retry/deliver
            coded in indexed hash of all SEND events, on msgid, with fast lookup of the Send for each Defer, and reporting/confirm on the exact amount of delay ea experienced (up to $detaillimit output).
        - fixed fundemental breaks in trailing echo blocks - weren't even functional, as last revised.
    * 5:43 PM 4/22/2025 CMW non-verb-ex2010: .ps1 version:
        - biggest issue, had to move func decl's to the top of BEGIN{ or they wouldn't register 
        - had to splice in additional functions, load-ADMS, get-GCFast, replaced the simplified write-log with the full version (w cbh & rem'd blocks pulled)
        - patch version in calls to Connect-ExchangeServerTDO (to 2010)

    * 4:51 PM 4/22/2025 added resolve-EnvironmentTDO alias: resolve-Environment; ADD: resolve-environment() & support, and updated start-log support; TLS_LATEST_FORCE ; missing regions; SWRITELOG ; SSTARTLOG ; 
        updated -Version supporting Connect-ExchangeServerTDO  ; convertFrom-MarkdownTable() to support... ; Initialize-xopEventIDTable; 
        fixed bug in -resultsize code; code to leverage Initialize-xopEventIDTable and output uniqued eventid's returnedon gmtl passes (doc output inline)
        copied over latest service conn code & slog for renv()
    * 3:23 PM 12/2/2024 throwing param transform errs on start & end (wyhen typed): pull typing, and do it post assignh, can't assign empty '' or $null to t a datetime coerced vary ;pre-reduce splat hash to populated values, in exmpl & BP use;
         rem out the parameterset code, and just do manual conflicting -start/-end -days tests and errors
    * 2:34 PM 11/26/2024 updated to latest 'Connect-ExchangeServerTDO()','get-ADExchangeServerTDO()', set to defer to existing
    * 4:20 PM 11/25/2024 updated from get-exomessagetraceexportedtdo(), more silent suppression, integrated dep-less ExOP conn supportadd delimters to echos, to space more, readability ;  fixed typo in eventid histo output
    * 3:16 PM 11/21/2024 working: added back Connectorid (postfiltered from results); add: $DaysLimit = 30 ; added: MsgsFail, MsgsDefer, MsgsFailRcpStat; 
    * 2:00 PM 11/20/2024 rounded out to iflv level, no dbg yet
    * 5:00 PM 10/14/2024 at this point roughed in ported updates from get-exomsgtracedetailed, no debugging/testing yet; updated params & cbh to semi- match vso\get-exomsgtracedetailed(); convert to a function (from ps1)
    * 11:30 AM 7/16/2024 CBH example typo fix
    * 2:41 PM 7/10/2024 spliced in notices for plus-addressing, ren'd $Tix -> $Ticket (matches gbug fi in psb.)
    * 12:57 PM 6/11/2024 Validated, Ex2010 & Ex2019, hub, mail & edge roles: tested ☑️ on CMW mail role (Curly); and Jumpbox;  finished test/debug on CMW edge: appears full functioning, including get-ADExchangeServerTDO() & Connect-ExchangeServerTDO()
    * 3:46 PM 6/3/2024 WIP for edge, latest chgs: rounded out params to subst cover full range of underlying Get-MessageTrackingLog: MessageID ; InternalMessageID; NetworkMessageID; Reference; ResultSize; 
        incl CH Example splatted call; shift conflicting sub bnr into $_sBnr; Also added param valid accomodating ResultSize is int32, $null or ''
    * 6;09 PM 5/30/2024 WIP for edge, finally got edge EMS code spliced in (from https://github.com/Lucifer1993/PLtools/blob/main/HealthChecker.ps1); 
    now connects see Get-MessageTrackingLog  runs & returns content on Edge; has trailing bug on exit
    You cannot call a method on a null-valued expression.
    At C:\scripts\Get-MessageTrackingLogTDO.ps1:952 char:16
    +     $smsg = "$($sBnr.replace('=v','=^').replace('v=','^='))" ;
    * 11:56 AM 5/30/2024 init; add: out-clipboard() ; spliced in conditional ordered hash code; transplanted psMsgTrkCMW.cbp into a full blown function; bonus: it runs fine in either org/enviro, as it's a full self contained solution to discover the local Exchange org from AD, then connect to the systems.

    .PARAMETER InternalMessageId
    The InternalMessageId parameter filters the message tracking log entries by the value of the InternalMessageId field. The InternalMessageId value is a message identifier that's assigned by the Exchange server that's currently processing the message.  The value of the internal-message-id for a specific message is different in the message tracking log of every Exchange server that's involved in the delivery of the message.
    .PARAMETER NetworkMessageId
    This field contains a unique message ID value that persists across copies of the message that may be created due to bifurcation or distribution group expansion. 
    .PARAMETER EventID
    The EventId parameter filters the results by the delivery status of the message (RECEIVE|DELIVER|FAIL|SEND|RESOLVE|EXPAND|TRANSFER|DEFER). [-Status 'Failed']")]
    .PARAMETER Reference
    The Reference field contains additional information for specific types of events. For example, the Reference field value for a DSN message tracking entry contains the InternalMessageId value of the message that caused the DSN. For many types of events, the value of Reference is blank

    .PARAMETER TransportTrafficType
    The TransportTrafficType parameter filters the message tracking log entries by the value of the TransportTrafficType field. However, this field isn't interesting for on-premises Exchange organizations[-TransportTrafficType xxx]
    .PARAMETER Version
    Specific Exchange Server Version to connect to('Ex2019|Ex2016|Ex2013|Ex2010|Ex2007|Ex2003|Ex2000')[-Version 'Ex2016']
    .PARAMETER Resultsize
    The ResultSize parameter specifies the maximum number of results to return. If you want to return all requests that match the query, use unlimited for the value of this parameter. The default value is 1000.
    .PARAMETER DetailLimit
    Integer number of maximum messages to be follow-up MessageTraceDetail'd (defaults to 20) [-DetailLimit 100]
    .PARAMETER Tag
    Tag string to be used in export filenames and output variablename[-Tag 'FromSenderX']
    .PARAMETER SimpleTrack
    switch to just return the net messages on the initial track (no Fail/Quarantine, MTDetail or other post-processing summaries) [-simpletrack]

    .PARAMETER Silent
    Suppress echoes.
    .INPUTS
    None. Does not accepted piped input.(.NET types, can add description)
    .OUTPUTS
    None. Returns no objects or output (.NET types)
    System.Boolean
    [| get-member the output to see what .NET obj TypeName is returned, to use here]

                    Proxied Powershell Automatic Variable that contains the full path to the script that invoked the current command. The value of this property is populated only when the caller is a script. (passed by external assignment to a variable, which is then passed to this function).
                    .PARAMETER PSCommandPathproxy
                    Proxied Powershell Automatic Variable that contains the full path and file name of the script that’s being run. This variable is valid in all scripts. (passed by external assignment to a variable, which is then passed to this function).
                    .PARAMETER MyInvocationproxy
                    Proxied Powershell Automatic Variable that contains information about the current command, such as the name, parameters, parameter values, and information about how the command was started, called, or invoked, such as the name of the script that called the current command. (passed by external assignment to a variable, which is then passed to this function).
                    .PARAMETER PSBoundParametersproxy
                    Proxied Powershell Automatic Variable that contains a dictionary of the parameters that are passed to a script or function and their current values. This variable has a value only in a scope where parameters are declared, such as a script or function. You can use it to display or change the current values of parameters or to pass parameter values to another script or function. (passed by external assignment to a variable, which is then passed to this function).

                .PARAMETER Object <System.Object>
                    Objects to display in the host.
                    .PARAMETER Path
                    The path to the log file to which you would like to write. By default the function will create the path and file if it does not exist.
                    .PARAMETER Level
                    Specify the criticality of the log information being written to the log (defaults Info): (Error|Warn|Info|H1|H2|H3|H4|H5|Debug|Verbose|Prompt|Success)[-level Info]
                    .PARAMETER useHost
                    Switch to use write-host rather than write-[verbose|warn|error] (does not apply to H1|H2|H3|DEBUG which alt via uncolored write-host) [-useHost]
                    .PARAMETER NoEcho
                    Switch to suppress console echos (e.g log to file only [-NoEcho]
                    .PARAMETER NoClobber
                    Use NoClobber if you do not wish to overwrite an existing file.
                    .PARAMETER BackgroundColor
                    Specifies the background color. There is no default. The acceptable values for this parameter are:
                    (Black | DarkBlue | DarkGreen | DarkCyan | DarkRed | DarkMagenta | DarkYellow | Gray | DarkGray | Blue | Green | Cyan | Red | Magenta | Yellow | White)
                    .PARAMETER ForegroundColor <System.ConsoleColor>
                    Specifies the text color. There is no default. The acceptable values for this parameter are:
                    (Black | DarkBlue | DarkGreen | DarkCyan | DarkRed | DarkMagenta | DarkYellow | Gray | DarkGray | Blue | Green | Cyan | Red | Magenta | Yellow | White)
                    .PARAMETER NoNewline <System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter>
                    The string representations of the input objects are concatenated to form the output. No spaces or newlines are inserted between
                    the output strings. No newline is added after the last output string.
                    .PARAMETER Separator <System.Object>
                    Specifies a separator string to insert between objects displayed by the host.
                    .PARAMETER PadChar
                    Character to use for padding (defaults to a space).[-PadChar '-']
                    .PARAMETER usePID
                    Switch to use the `$PID in the `$env:HostIndentSpaces name (Env:HostIndentSpaces`$PID)[-usePID]
                    .PARAMETER Indent
                    Switch to use write-HostIndent-type code for console echos(see get-help write-HostIndent)[-Indent]
                    .PARAMETER Flatten
                    Switch to strip empty lines when using -Indent (which auto-splits multiline Objects)[-Flatten]
                    .PARAMETER ShowDebug
                    Parameter to display Debugging messages [-ShowDebug switch]
                    .PARAMETER demo
	                Switch to output a demo display of each Level, and it's configured color scheme (requires specification of a 'dummy' message string to avoid an error).[-Demo]
                    .EXAMPLE
                    PS>  Write-Log -Message 'Log message'   ;
                    Writes the message to default log loc (c:\Logs\PowerShellLog.log, -level defaults to Info).
                    .EXAMPLE
                    PS> Write-Log -Message 'Restarting Server.' -Path c:\Logs\Scriptoutput.log ;
                    Writes the content to the specified log file and creates the path and file specified.
                    .EXAMPLE
                    PS> write-log -level warn "some information" -Path c:\tmp\tmp.txt
                    WARNING: 10:17:59: some information
                    Demo default use of the native write-warning cmdlet (default behavior when -useHost is not used)
                    .EXAMPLE
                    PS> write-log -level warn "some information" -Path c:\tmp\tmp.txt -usehost
                        10:19:14: WARNING: some information
                    Demo use of the "warning" color scheme write-host cmdlet (behavior when -useHost *IS* used)
                    .EXAMPLE
                    PS> Write-Log -level Prompt -Message "Enter Text:" -Path c:\tmp\tmp.txt -usehost  ;
                    PS> invoke-soundcue -type question ;
                    PS> $enteredText = read-host ;
                    Echo's a distinctive Prompt color scheme for the message (vs using read-host native non-color-differentiating -prompt parameter), and writes a 'Prompt'-level entry to the log, uses my verb-io:invoke-soundCue to play a the system question sound; then uses promptless read-host to take typed input.
                    PS> Write-Log -level Prompt -Message "Enter Password:" -Path c:\tmp\tmp.txt -usehost  ;
                    PS> invoke-soundcue -type question ;

                    When using -Indent with group'd or other cmd-multiline output, you will want to:
                    1. use the...
                        $smsg = $(([results]|out-string).trim())"
                        ...structure to pre-clean & convert from [FormatEntryData] to [string]
                        (avoids errors, due to formatteddata *not* having split mehtod)
                    2. Use -flatten to avoid empty _colored_ lines between each entry in the output (and sprinkle write-host "`n`n"'s pre/post for separation).
                    These issues only occur under -Indent use, due to the need to `$Object.split to get each line of indented object properly collored and indented.

                                        To access the management console on the transport server, I opened PowerShell then ran

                                        Followed by

                REVISIONS
                * 10;05 am 4/30/2025 fixed code for Edge role in raw PS, missing evaris for Ex: added discovery from reg & stock file system dirs for version etc.
                * 3:57 PM 11/26/2024 updated simple write-host,write-verbose with full pswlt support;  syncd dbg & vx10 copies.
                * 12:57 PM 6/11/2024 Validated, Ex2010 & Ex2019, hub, mail & edge roles: tested ☑️ on CMW mail role (Curly); and Jumpbox; copied in CBH from repo copy, which has been updated/debugged compat on CMW Edge 
                * 2:05 PM 8/28/2023 REN -> Get-ExchangeServerInSite -> get-ADExchangeServerTDO (aliased orig); to better steer profile-level options - including in cmw org, added -TenOrg, and default Site to constructed vari, targeting new profile $XXX_ADSiteDefault vari; Defaulted -Roles to HUB,CAS as well.
                * 3:42 PM 8/24/2023 spliced together combo of my long-standing, and some of the interesting ideas BF's version had. Functional prod:
                    - completely removed ActiveDirectory module dependancies from BF's code, and reimplemented in raw ADSI calls. Makes it fully portable, even into areas like Edge DMZ roles, where ADMS would never be installed.

                * 3:17 PM 8/23/2023 post Edge testing: some logic fixes; add: -Names param to filter on server names; -Site & supporting code, to permit lookup against sites *not* local to the local machine (and bypass lookup on the local machine) ; 
                    ren $Ex10siteDN -> $ExOPsiteDN; ren $Ex10configNC -> $ExopconfigNC
                * 1:03 PM 8/22/2023 minor cleanup
                * 10:31 AM 4/7/2023 added CBH expl of postfilter/sorting to draw predictable pattern 
                * 4:36 PM 4/6/2023 validated Psv51 & Psv20 and Ex10 & 16; added -Roles & -RoleNames params, to perform role filtering within the function (rather than as an external post-filter step). 
                For backward-compat retain historical output field 'Roles' as the msexchcurrentserverroles summary integer; 
                use RoleNames as the text role array; 
                    updated for psv2 compat: flipped hash key lookups into properties, found capizliation differences, (psv2 2was all lower case, wouldn't match); 
                flipped the [pscustomobject] with new... psobj, still psv2 doesn't index the hash keys ; updated for Ex13+: Added  16  "UM"; 20  "CAS, UM"; 54  "MBX" Ex13+ ; 16385 "CAS" Ex13+ ; 16439 "CAS, HUB, MBX" Ex13+
                Also hybrided in some good ideas from SammyKrosoft's Get-SKExchangeServers.psm1 
                (emits Version, Site, low lvl Roles # array, and an array of Roles, for post-filtering); 
                # 11:20 AM 4/21/2021 fixed/suppressed noisy verbose calls
                * 12:08 PM 5/15/2020 fixed vpn issue: Try/Catch'd around recently failing $ADSite::GetComputerSite().GetDirectoryEntry().distinguishedName qry
                * 11:22 AM 3/13/2020 Get-ExchangeServerInSite added a ping-test, to only return matches that are pingable, added -NoPing param, to permit (faster) untested bypass
                * 6:59 PM 1/15/2020 cleanup
                # 10:03 AM 11/16/2018 Get-ExchangeServerInSite:can't do AD-related functions when not AD authentictaed (home, pre-vpn connect). Added if/then test on status and abort balance when false.
                * 11/18/18 BF's posted rev
                # 12:10 PM 8/1/2017 updated example code at bottom, to accommodate variant sites
                # 11:28 AM 3/31/2016 validated that latest round of updates are still functional
                #1:58 PM 9/3/2015 - added pshelp and some docs
                #April 12, 2010 - web version
                .DESCRIPTION
                get-ADExchangeServerTDO.ps1 - Returns Exchangeserver summary(s) from AD records

                Hybrided together ideas from Brian Farnsworth's blog post
                [PowerShell - ActiveDirectory and Exchange Servers – CodeAndKeep.Com – Code and keep calm...](https://codeandkeep.com/PowerShell-ActiveDirectory-Exchange-Part1/)
                ... with much older concepts from  Sammy Krosoft, and much earlier Mike Pfeiffer. 

                - Subbed in MP's use of ADSI for ActiveDirectory Ps mod cmds - it's much more dependancy-free; doesn't require explicit install of the AD ps module
                ADSI support is built into windows.
                - spliced over my addition of Roles, RoleNames, Name & NoTest params, for prefiltering and suppressing testing.


                [briansworth · GitHub](https://github.com/briansworth)

                Uses an ADSI DirectorySearcher to search the current Active Directory site for Exchange on-prem servers.
                        Intent is to discover connection points for Powershell, wo the need to preload/pre-connect to Exchange.

                        But, as a non-Exchange-Management-Shell-dependant info source on Exchange Server configs, it can be used before connection, with solely AD-available data, to check configuration spes on the subject server(s). 

                        For example, this query will return sufficient data under Version to indicate which revision of Exchange is in use:


                        Returned object (in array):
                        Site      : {ADSITENAME}
                        Roles     : {64}
                        Version   : {Version 15.1 (Build 32375.7)}
                        Name      : SERVERNAME
                        RoleNames : EDGE
                        FQDN      : SERVERNAME.DOMAIN.TLD

                        ... includes the post-filterable Role property ($_.Role -contains 'CAS') which reflects the following
                        installed-roles ('msExchCurrentServerRoles') on the discovered servers
                            2   {"MBX"} # Ex10
                            4   {"CAS"}
                            16  {"UM"}
                            20  {"CAS, UM" -split ","} # 
                            32  {"HUB"}
                            36  {"CAS, HUB" -split ","}
                            38  {"CAS, HUB, MBX" -split ","}
                            54  {"MBX"} # Ex13+
                            64  {"EDGE"}
                            16385   {"CAS"} # Ex13+
                            16439   {"CAS, HUB, MBX"  -split ","} # Ex13+
                .PARAMETER Roles
                Array of msExchCurrentServerRoles 'role' integers to be filtered against (2|4|16|20|32|36|38|54|64|16385|16439)[-Roles @(38,16385)]
                .PARAMETER RoleNames
                Array of Server 'Role' name strings to be filtered against (MBX|CAS|HUB|UM|MBX|EDGE)[-RoleNames 'HUB','CAS']
                .PARAMETER Server
                Array of Server name strings to be filtered against[-Server 'SERVER1','SERVER2']
                .PARAMETER SiteName
                Name of specific AD SiteName to be searched for ExchangeServers (defaults to global variable `$TenOrg_ADSiteDefaultName if present)[-SiteName 'SITENAME']
                .PARAMETER TenOrg
                Tenant Tag (3-letter abbrebiation - defaults to variable `$global:o365_TenOrgDefault if present)[-TenOrg 'XYZ']
                .PARAMETER NoPing
                Switch to suppress default 'pingable' test (e.g. returns all matches, no testing)[-NoPing]
                .INPUTS
                None. Does not accepted piped input.(.NET types, can add description)
                .OUTPUTS
                None. Returns no objects or output (.NET types)
                System.Boolean
                [| get-member the output to see what .NET obj TypeName is returned, to use here]
                System.Array of System.Object's
                .EXAMPLE
                PS> If(!($ExchangeServer)){$ExchangeServer = (get-ADExchangeServerTDO| ?{$_.RoleNames -contains 'CAS' -OR $_.RoleNames -contains 'HUB' -AND ($_.FQDN -match "^SITECODE") } | Get-Random ).FQDN
                Return a random Hub Cas Role server in the local Site with a fqdn beginning SITECODE
                .EXAMPLE
                PS> $localADExchserver = get-ADExchangeServerTDO -Names $env:computername -SiteName ([System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.ActiveDirectorySite]::GetComputerSite().name)
                Demo, if run from an Exchange server, return summary details about the local server (-SiteName isn't required, is default imputed from local server's Site, but demos explicit spec for remote sites)
                .EXAMPLE
                PS> $regex = '(' + [regex]($ADSiteCodeUK,$ADSiteCodeAU -join "|") + ')'
                PS> switch -regex ($($env:computername).substring(0,3)){
                PS>    "$($ADSiteCodeUS)" {$tExRole=36 } ;
                PS>    "$($regex)" {$tExRole= 38 }  default { write-error "$((get-date).ToString('HH:mm:ss')):UNRECOGNIZED SERVER PREFIX!."; } ;
                PS> } ;
                PS> $exhubcas = (get-ADExchangeServerTDO |?{($_.roles -eq $tExRole) -AND ($_.FQDN -match "$($env:computername.substring(0,3)).*")} | Get-Random ).FQDN ;
                Use a switch block to select different role combo targets for a given server fqdn prefix string.
                .EXAMPLE
                PS> $ExchangeServer = get-ADExchangeServerTDO | ?{$_.Roles -match '(4|20|32|36|38|16385|16439)'} | select -expand fqdn | get-random ; 
                Another/Older approach filtering on the Roles integer (targeting combos with Hub or CAS in the mix)
                .EXAMPLE
                PS> $ret = get-ADExchangeServerTDO -Roles @(4,20,32,36,38,16385,16439) -verbose 
                Demo use of the -Roles param, feeding it an array of Role integer values to be filtered against. In this case, the Role integers that include a CAS or HUB role.
                .EXAMPLE
                PS> $ret = get-ADExchangeServerTDO -RoleNames 'HUB','CAS' -verbose ;
                Demo use of the -RoleNames param, feeding it the array 'HUB','CAS' Role name strings to be filtered against
                PS> $ret = get-ADExchangeServerTDO -Names 'SERVERName' -verbose ;
                Demo use of the -RoleNames param, feeding it the array 'HUB','CAS' Role name strings to be filtered against
                .EXAMPLE
                PS> $ExchangeServer = get-ADExchangeServerTDO | sort version,roles,name | ?{$_.rolenames -contains 'CAS'}  | select -last 1 | select -expand fqdn ;
                Demo post sorting & filtering, to deliver a rule-based predictable pattern for server selection: 
                Above will always pick the highest Version, 'CAS' RoleName containing, alphabetically last server name (that is pingable). 
                And should stick to that pattern, until the servers installed change, when it will shift to the next predictable box.
                .EXAMPLE
                PS> $ExOPServer = get-ADExchangeServerTDO -Name LYNMS650 -SiteName Lyndale
                PS> if([double]$ExVersNum = [regex]::match($ExOPServer.version,"Version\s(\d+\.\d+)\s\(Build\s(\d+\.\d+)\)").groups[1].value){
                PS>     switch -regex ([string]$ExVersNum) {
                PS>         '15\.2' { $isEx2019 = $true ; $ExVers = 'Ex2019' }
                PS>         '15\.1' { $isEx2016 = $true ; $ExVers = 'Ex2016'}
                PS>         '15\.0' { $isEx2013 = $true ; $ExVers = 'Ex2013'}
                PS>         '14\..*' { $isEx2010 = $true ; $ExVers = 'Ex2010'}
                PS>         '8\..*' { $isEx2007 = $true ; $ExVers = 'Ex2007'}
                PS>         '6\.5' { $isEx2003 = $true ; $ExVers = 'Ex2003'}
                PS>         '6|6\.0' {$isEx2000 = $true ; $ExVers = 'Ex2000'} ;
                PS>         default {
                PS>             $smsg = "UNRECOGNIZED ExchangeServer.AdminDisplayVersion.Major.Minor string:$($ExOPServer.version)! ABORTING!" ;

                PS> }else {
                PS>     $smsg = "UNABLE TO RESOLVE `$ExVersNum from `$ExOPServer.version:$($ExOPServer.version)!" ;

                PS>     break ; 
                PS> } ; 
                Demo of parsing the returned Version property, into the proper Exchange Server revision.

            .DESCRIPTION
            remove-SmtpPlusAddress - Strips any Plus address Tag present in an smtp address, and returns the base address

            Plus Addressing is supported in Exchange Online, Gmail, and other select hosts. 
            It is *not* supported for Exchange Server onprem. Any + addressed email will read as an unresolvable email address. 
            Supporting systems will truncate the local part (in front of the @), after the +, to resolve the email address for normal routing:

            monitoring+whatever@domain.tld, is cleaned down to: monitor@domain.tld. 

            .PARAMETER EmailAddress
            SMTP Email Address
            .OUTPUT
            String
            .EXAMPLE
            PS> 
            PS> $returned = remove-SmtpPlusAddress -EmailAddress 'monitoring+SolarWinds@toro.com';  
            PS> $returned ; 
            Demo retrieving get-EmailAddress, assigning to output, processing it for version info, and expanding the populated returned values to local variables. 
            .EXAMPLE
            ps> remove-SmtpPlusAddress -EmailAddress 'monitoring+SolarWinds@toro.com;notanemailaddresstoro.com,todd+spam@kadrie.net' -verbose ;
            Demo with comma and semicolon delimiting, and an invalid address (to force a regex match fail error).

        REVISIONS
        * 9:41 AM 10/2/2025 updated CBH w expanded comment about why running both this, and Resolve-xopBuildSemVersToTextNameTDO: they output different ProductName equivelents,
            which are already stored in build state .xml files on servers (would change the spec mid-build)
        * 10:48 AM 9/22/2025 port to uwes's as _func.ps1 (not a generic mod use; load when needed) from xopBuildLibrary; add CBH, and Adv Function specs
        * 1:58 PM 8/8/2025 added CBH; init; renamed AdminAccount -> Account, aliased  orig param and logon variant. ren: Get-SetupTextVersionTDO -> Get-SetupTextVersionTDO, aliased orig name
        .DESCRIPTION
        Get-SetupTextVersionTDO - Resolves an Exchange Server binary file (.exe, .dll, etc)'s SemanticVersion value (in 4-integer dot-separated format), to matching Exchange Version Text string. Works for either installed bins, or setup cab bins.
        
        This is of very limited utility: Duped from install-Exchange15-TTC.ps1, solely to support out of band calls to that function: 
        - Works with a static array of recent builds of installable RTM/SP/CU builds. 
        - by contrast verb-io\Get-FileVersionTDO() covers every version of Exchange Server back to 4.0, including every SU & HU. Issue between the two, 
            is Resolve-xopBuildSemVersToTextNameTDO's ProductName reflects MS's version doc page string; 
            while 821\Get-SetupTextVersion() returns a non-standard name for the same build/CU 
            ('Exchange Server 2016 CU23 (2022H1)' v 'Exchange Server 2016 Cumulative Update 23')
            Retaining both, to avoid changing rev version strings already stored in server build state .xml files

        I could recode get-fileversionTDO() to emulate this, but would have to externalize logic to 'fail' unsupportedbuilds, as this doesn't just reesolve .exe build SemVers, 
            it also aribtrates if your version isn't supported. So we go static.
        This is *not* in any module, but xopBuildLibrary.ps1. There' no ongoing benefit to building it into vx10 etc.
        I'll park a _func.ps1 copy out in uwes, for other use.

        This is designed to track the core/build-installable CU & RTM builds (vs hotfixes etc).

    .DESCRIPTION
    get-UserMailADSummary.ps1 - Resolve specified array of -users (displayname, emailaddress, samaccountname) to mail asset and AD details
    The specific goal of this function is to assist in differentiated 'Active' user mailboxes from termainted/disabled/offboarded user mailboxes (or (Shared|Room|Equpment)mailboxes with disabled ADUser accounts.
    
    Fed an array of mailbox descriptors - emailaddress/UPN, alias, displayname, etc) - the function attempts to resolve a local recipient object, and a matching local ADUser object. 

    The ADUser is evaluated for .enabled status, and the distinguishedName is checked to locate 'non-Active/Term' users (by OU name in their DN). 
    
    The resulting lookups are categorized into four properties of the returned SystemObject:
    - Enabled - resolved local recipient & local ADUser. ADUser.Enabled=$true, ADUser.distinguishedName does not include a 'Disabled*' or 'Termed*' OU in it's tree.
    - Disabled - resolved local recipient, & local ADUser. ADUser.Enabled=$false and/or ADUser.distinguishedName includes a 'Disabled*' or 'Termed*' OU in it's tree.
    - UnResolved - get-recipient failed to return a local recipient matching the specified mailbox designator (most frequently reflects EXO cloud mailboxes that are hybrid-federated out of an other external AD as Source-Of-Authority.
    - Failed - any get-recipient try/catch fail that doesn't appear to be Exception.Type 'System.Management.Automation.RemoteException', Exception match "couldn't\sbe\sfound\son"

    The resulting SystemObject from the above is returned to the pipeline.
    .PARAMETER  users
    Array of user descriptors: displayname, emailaddress, UPN, samaccountname (checks clipboard where unspecified)
    .PARAMETER ADDisabledOnly
    Switch to exclude users solely on ADUser.disabled (not Disabled OU presense), or with that have the ADUser below an OU matching '*OU=(Disabled|TERMedUsers)'  [-ADDisabledOnly]
    .PARAMETER useEXOv2
    Use EXOv2 (ExchangeOnlineManagement) over basic auth legacy connection [-useEXOv2]
    .INPUTS
    None. Does not accepted piped input.(.NET types, can add description)
    .OUTPUTS
    Returns a System.Object[] object to pipeline, with subsets of processed users as 'Enabled' (ADUser.enabled),'Disabled', and 'Contacts' properties. 
    .EXAMPLE
    PS> $rpt = get-UserMailADSummary -users 'username1','user2@domain.com','[distinguishedname]' ;
    PS> $rpt | export-csv -nottype ".\pathto\usersummaries-$(get-date -format 'yyyyMMdd-HHmmtt').csv" ; 
    Processes local/remotemailbox & ADUser details on three specified users (alias,email address, DN). Summaries are returned to pipeline, and assigned to the $rpt variable, which is then exported to csv.
    .EXAMPLE
    PS> $rpt = get-UserMailADSummary -users 'username1','user2@domain.com','[distinguishedname]' -ADDisabledOnly ;
    PS> $rpt | export-csv -nottype ".\pathto\usersummaries-ENABLEDUSERS-$(get-date -format 'yyyyMMdd-HHmmtt').csv" ; 
    Processes local/remotemailbox & ADUser details on three specified users (alias,email address, DN). 
    And allocate as 'Disabled', accounts that are *solely* ADUser.disabled 
    (e.g. considers users below OU's with names like 'OU=Disabled*' as 'Enabled' users), 
    and then exports to csv. 
    .EXAMPLE
    $rpt = get-UserMailADSummary -users 'username1','user2@domain.com','[distinguishedname]' ;
    $rpt.enabled | export-csv -nottype ".\pathto\usersummaries-ENABLEDUSERS-$(get-date -format 'yyyyMMdd-HHmmtt').csv" ;
    Process specified identifiers, and export solely the 'Enabled' users returned to csv.

    get-xopExchangeLocalVersionTDO - Checks local server's status as an Exchange Server (checks for Exchange Services, Registry Keys, key roles, versions), without reliance on Exchange Mgmt Shell). Differs from vx10\get-xopServerAdminDisplayVersion(), in that it isn't intended to be run for remotely server version verification, and avoids reliance on get-exchangeserver and other Exchange Mgmt Shell dependancies.

    * 11:06 AM 4/4/2025:
        - udpated CBH (updates more extensive demos);
        - add: -GetServiceUpdate; echo's last BuildTable date, and url to screen; 
            pre-resolve specified Computername to DNS A record fqdn (( via Resolve-DNS -name Computername -Type A).name)
            Object returned to pipeline includes ServiceUpdateVersion & ServiceUpdateProduct , when -getServiceUpdate param is used.
        - removed: fqdn retry code (no longer needed if pre-fqdn'ing)
    * 1:28 PM 3/26/2025 updated CBH, with description/specifics on admindisplayversion returned by get-exchangeserver
        strange: initial atttempts on the lowest # local hub consisntly failed lookup on nbname, so added code to retry with resolved A record/fqdn; 
        ren Get-ExchangeVersion -> get-xopServerAdminDisplayVersion ; 
        updated CBH; 
        updated BuildToProductName indexed hash to specs posted as of 3/26/2025 at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/new-features/build-numbers-and-release-dates

    .DESCRIPTION
    get-xopServerAdminDisplayVersion.ps1 - Retrieves specified ComputerName's (get-exchangeserver).AdminDisplayVersion ~ Cumulative Update version (can optionally retrieve actual Service Update version w -getSErviceUpdate param)

    Expanded variant of tSC's posted script at https://thesysadminchannel.com. 
    - Expands coverage back through 'Exchange Server 2010 RTM', and as of latest BuildToProductName update, through 'Exchange Server 2019 CU15 (2025H1)'
    - Adds SU retrieval (via -getServiceUpdate param, reads remote server ExSetup.exe file version)
    - More fault tolerance (pre-expands specified -ComputerNames into DNS A record fqdn's - seems to avoid sporadic issues retrieving get-exchangeserver & remote invoke-expression; 
        adds code to retry failing queries)
    - BuildToProductName is updated through 3/25/25 current info, and reflects the MS Build table product name strings (unmodified; simpler to maintain over time). 

    Per [Exchange Server build numbers and release dates | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/new-features/build-numbers-and-release-dates?view=exchserver-2019)

    Method details: 
    get-exchangeserver [server] returns Admindisplayversion like : 
    
        Version nn.n (Build nnn.n)
    
    The Buildnumber Shortstring can be converted to a value suitable for BuildToProductName indexed hash lookup, 
    by combining the 'Version nn.n' digits with the '(Build nnn.n)' digits, into: nn.n.nnn.n
    Handled via this regex: 
    
        [regex]::Matches($AdminDisplayVersion,"(\d*\.\d*)").value -join '.'

    If using version-specific code, do any matching on the nn.n for each Major rev, if you want to be sure of your supported commandset targets
        - 2019, 'Version 15.2'
        - 2016, 'Version 15.1'
        - 2013, 'Version 15.0'
        - 2010sp3, 'Version 14.3'

    .DESCRIPTION
    import-EMSLocalModule - Setup local server bin-module-based ExchOnPrem Mgmt Shell connection (contrasts with Ex2007/10 snapin use ; validated Exch2016)
    Wraps the native ex server desktop EMS, .lnk commands:
    . 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\bin\RemoteExchange.ps1';
    Connect-ExchangeServer -auto -ClientApplication:ManagementShell
    Handy for loading local non-dehydrated support in ISE, regular PS etc, where existing code relies on non-dehydrated objects.
    .INPUTS
    None. Does not accepted piped input.
    .OUTPUTS
    None. Returns no objects or output.

        Initialize-xopEventIDTable - Builds an indexed hash tabl of Exchange Server Get-MessageTrackingLog EventIDs

        ## Exchange 2019 EventID reference:

        [Event types in the message tracking log | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/mail-flow/transport-logs/message-tracking?view=exchserver-2019#event-types-in-the-message-tracking-log)

        Doesn't include Edge eventid: 
        "SENDEXTERNAL          | A message was sent by SMTP to sent to the SMTP server responsible to receive the email for the external email address."
    
        (needs to be manually spliced in below 'SEND' during updates from source MS documentation)
    
        .OUTPUT
        System.Collections.Hashtable returns an Indexed Hash of EventIDs EventName to Description

    .DESCRIPTION
    Invoke-ExchangeCommand.ps1 - PowerShell function allows you to run PowerShell commands and script blocks on Exchange servers in different forests without a forest trust.
    This PowerShell function allows you to run PowerShell commands and script blocks on Exchange servers in different forests without a forest trust.
    To run Invoke-ExchangeCommand, you must connect to the Exchange server using a hostname and not an IP address. Invoke-ExchangeCommand works best on Server 2012 R2/Windows 8.1 and later but also works on Server 2008 R2/Windows 7. Tested on Exchange 2010 and later. More information on cross-forest Exchange PowerShell can be found here: http://markgossa.blogspot.com/2015/10/exchange-2010-2013-cross-forest-remote-powershell.html
    Usage:
    1. Enable connections to all PowerShell hosts:
    winrm s winrm/config/client '@{TrustedHosts="*"}'
    # TSK: OR BETTER: _SELECTIVE_ HOSTS:
    Set-Item -Path WSMan:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts -Value 'LYNMS7330.global.ad.toro.com' -Concatenate -Force ; Get-Item -Path WSMan:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts | fl Name, Value ;
    cd WSMan:\localhost\Client ;
    dir | format-table -auto ; # review existing settings:
    # AllowEncrypted is defined on the client end, via the WSMAN: drive
    set-item .\allowunencrypted $true ;
    # You probably will need to set the AllowUnencrypted config setting in the Service as well, which has to be changed in the remote server using the following:
    set-item -force WSMan:\localhost\Service\AllowUnencrypted $true ;
    # tsk: reverted it back out:

    # 12:51 PM 10/4/2019 passing initial whatif on -Room
    # 2:22 PM 10/1/2019 2076 & 1549 added: $FallBackBaseUserOU, OU that's used when can't find any baseuser for the owner's OU, default to a random shared from SITECODE (avoid crapping out):

    # 10:00 AM 11/20/2018 major update, switched 99% of write-xxx to write-log support, so it now produces a realtime 'log' of the build of the mailbox. Better than transcript because it still logs the changes right up to crashes. And it's only the _relevant) changes.

            into the other new-mailbox based scripts. This explains why nothing has been setting owner-based domains in recent (months)?.

    * 2:48 PM 1/19/2026 -whatif's find ; 
    * 10:48 AM 1/19/2026 bugfix: $pltCcOPSvcs.UserRole (postfilter, not match test)
    # 12:20 PM 1/16/2026 check out against AAD->MG migr mandate, bring in latest logging & SERVICE_CONNECTIONS blocks
    # 2:46 PM 1/24/2025 add support for $OfficeOverride = 'Pune, IN' ; support for Office that doesn't match SITE OU code: $OfficeOverride = 'Pune, IN' ; 
    # 10:56 AM 4/12/2024 fix: echo typo 889:FIRSTNAME -> LASTNAME
    # 2:36 PM 8/2/2023 have to bump up password complexity - revised policy., it does support fname.lname naming & email addreses, just have to pass in dname with period. but the dname will also come out with the same period (which if they specified the eml, implies they don't mind if the name has it)
    # 10:30 AM 10/13/2021 pulled [int] from $ticket , to permit non-numeric & multi-tix
    # 10:01 AM 9/14/2021 had a random creation bug - but debugged fine in ISE (bad PSS?), beefed up Catch block outputs, captured new-mailbox output & recycled; added 7pswhsplat outputs prior to cmds.
    # 4:37 PM 5/18/2021 fixed broken start-log call (wasn't recycling logspec into logfile & transcrpt)
    # 11:10 AM 5/11/2021 swapped parentpath code for dyn module-support code (moving the new-mailboxgenerictor & add-mbxaccessgrant preproc .ps1's to ex2010 mod functions)
    # 1:52 PM 5/5/2021 added dot-divided displayname support (split fname & lname for generics, to auto-gen specific requested eml addresses) ; diverted parentpath log pref to d: before c: w test; untested code
    # 8:34 AM 3/31/2021 added verbose suppress to all import-mods
    # 1:29 PM 4/23/2020 updated dynpath & logging, unwrapped loadmod,
    # 4:28 PM 4/22/2020 updated logging code, to accomodate dynamic locations and $ParentPath
    # 4:36 PM 4/8/2020 works fully on jumpbox, but ignores whatif, renamed $bwhatif -> $whatif (as the b variant was prev set in the same-script, now separate scopes); swapped out CU5 switch, moved settings into infra file, genericized
    # 2:15 PM 4/7/2020 updated to reflect debugging on jumpbox
    # 2:35 PM 4/3/2020 new-MailboxShared: genericized for pub, moved material into infra, updated hybrid mod loads, cleaned up comments/remmed material ; updated to use start-log, debugged to funciton on jumpbox, w divided modules ; added -ParentPath to pass through a usable path for start-log, within new-mailboxshared()
    # 8:48 AM 11/26/2019 new-MailboxShared():moved the Office spec from $MbxSplat => $MbxSetSplat. New-Mailbox syntax set that supports -Shared, doesn't support -Office
    # 12:14 PM 10/4/2019 splice in Room/Equip code from new-mailboxConfRm.ps1's variant (not functionalized yet), added new -Room & -Equipement flags to trigger ConfRm code
    # 2:22 PM 10/1/2019 2076 & 1549 added: $FallBackBaseUserOU, OU that's used when can't find any baseuser for the owner's OU, default to a random shared from SITECODE (avoid crapping out):
    # 9:48 AM 9/27/2019 new-MailboxShared:added `a 'beep' to YYY prompt
    # 1:47 PM 9/20/2019 switched to auto mailbox distribution (ALL TO SITECODE dbs)
    # 12:06 PM 6/12/2019 functionalized version new-MailboxGenericTOR.ps1 => new-MailboxShared
    # 8:04 AM 5/31/2019 2441 exempted EAS info reporting from shared/generic mailboxes (EAS isn't core supported by EXO, no sense pointing out it is onprem)
    # 11:17 AM 5/8/2019 spliced in updated hybrid baseuser resolve code from new-mailboxConfRm.ps1
    # 8:41 AM 4/30/2019 #2327: add lab support for UPN build fr email addr:
    # 2:19 PM 4/29/2019 add $($DomTOLfqdn) to the domain param validateset on get-gcfast copy (sync'd in from verb-ex2010.ps1 vers), lab psv2 LACKS the foreign-lang cleanup funtions below, exempt use on psv2
    # 10:39 AM 4/1/2019 added: Remove-StringDiacritic, Remove-StringLatinCharacters(), and purging non-AAD-syncable chars from upn, mail alias etc. Ran a test pass. Also pre-cleaning the fname/lname/dname before using it to build samaccountname. Debugged & ran fine, creating a mbx.
    # 11:15 AM 2/15/2019 copied in bug-fixed write-log() with fixed debug support
    # 10:41 AM 2/15/2019 updated write-log to latest deferring version
    # 2:26 PM 12/13/2018 SITECODE has all mbxs moved out, need to poll remotembxs for baseuser!
    # 10:00 AM 11/20/2018 major update, switched 99% of write-xxx to write-log support, so it now produces a realtime 'log' of the build of the mailbox. Better than transcript because it still logs the changes right up to crashes. And it's only the _relevant) changes.
    # downside: lacks color coding unless I want to code in WARNs, which would be logged as warns.
    # 12:04 PM 7/18/2018 made display of password conditional (!shared)
    # 10:28 AM 6/27/2018 add $domaincontroller param option - skips dc discovery process and uses the spec, also updated $findOU code to work with TOL dom
    # 10:59 AM 5/21/2018 Fixed broken -nongeneric $true functionality: (corrected samaccountname gen code for blank fname field). Also added Mailuser/RemoteMailbox support for -Owner value. Validated functional for creation of the LYNCmonacct1 mbx.
    # 11:25 AM 12/22/2017 missing casmailbox splat construct for psv2 section, update CU5 test regx for perrotde & perrotpl, output an error when it fails to find a BaseUser (new empty site with empty target OU to draw from, prompts to hand spec -BaseUser param with mbx in another OU or loc
    # 11:58 AM 11/15/2017 1321: accommodate EXO-hosted Owners by testing with get-remotemailbox -AND get-mailbox on the owner spec. Created a mailbox, seemed to work. Not sure of access grant script yet.
    # 11:43 AM 10/6/2017 made $Cu5 Mandatry:$false
    # 10:30 AM 10/6/2017 fix typo in $cu5 switch
    # 8:41 AM 10/6/2017 major re-splict to read lost set-mailbox (alt domain assignment) & set-casmailbox material. Need to splice this code
            into the other new-mailbox based scripts. This explains why nothing has been setting owner-based domains in recent (months)?.
    # 3:22 PM 10/4/2017 midway through adding CU5 support
    # 2:38 PM 6/22/2017 LastName too, strip all names back
    # 2:30 PM 6/22/2017 Mbx.Name attrib appears to be a 64char limit!
    # 12:49 PM 5/31/2017 add $NoPrompt
    # 8:18 AM 5/9/2017 fixed minotr #region/#endregion typos
    # 1:29 PM 4/3/2017 #1764: this should have the -server spec
    # 2:39 PM 3/21/2017 spliced over sitemailboxOU() from new-mailboxconfrm.ps1
    # 8:03 AM 3/16/2017 suppress error make sure the $($script:ExPSS).ID  is EVEN POPULATED!
    # 7:56 AM 3/16/2017 gadu need a dawdle loop, also add -server $(InputSplat.domaincontroller)
    # 9:48 AM 3/2/2017 merged in updated Add-EMSRemote Set
    # 1:30 PM 2/27/2017 neither vscan cu9 nor owner's cu5 values got properly populated.
    # 12:36 PM 2/27/2017 get-SiteMbxOU(): fixed to cover breaks frm AD reorg OU name changes, Generics are all now in a single OU per site
    # 1:04 PM 2/24/2017 tweak below
    #12:56 PM 2/24/2017 doesn't run worth a damn SITECODE-> $($ADSiteCodeAU)/$($ADSiteCodeUK), force it to abort (avoid half-built remote objects that take too long to replicate back to SITECODE)
    # 11:37 AM 2/24/2017 Reporting loop: add RecipientType,RecipientTypeDetails
    # 11:35 AM 2/24/2017 ran initial debug pass, may work.
    # # 11:09 AM 2/24/2017 DMG gone: switch generics to real shared mbxs "Shared" = $True / $Inputsplat.shared
    #* 9:11 AM 9/30/2016 added pretest if(get-command -name set-AdServerSettings -ea 0)
    # 10:38 AM 6/7/2016 tested debugged 378194, generic creation. Now has new UPN set based on Primary SMTP dirname@DOMAIN.com.
    # 8:17 AM 6/7/2016 fixed to missing )'s in the splat dummy refactor bloc
    # 7:51 AM 6/7/2016 roughed in retries, and if/then cleanupexit blocks to make more fault tolerant. Needs debugging
    # 12:51 PM 5/10/2016 updated debug BP blocks
    # 2:07 PM 4/8/2016 minor tweaking
    # 12:32 PM 4/8/2016 submain: added validation that an existing $script:ExPSS is actually functional, or forces an Add-Emsremote
    # 11:28 AM 4/8/2016 passed EMSRemote dynamic
    # 11:25 AM 4/8/2016 passed initial test on Ex EMS local
    # 11:22 AM 4/8/2016 I think I've finally got it properly managing EMSRemote, purging redudant, and outputing functional report. needs to be tested in Ex EMS local
    # 12:31 PM 4/6/2016 it's crapping out in local EMS on SITECODE-3V6KSY1 Add-EMSRemote isn't picking up on the existing verbs, and noclobber etc.
    # 12:29 PM 4/6/2016 validated Generic in rEMS
    # 12:23 PM 4/6/2016: seems functional for testing.
        Added Validate-Password, and looping pw gen, to generate consistently compliant complexity.
        Debugged through a lot of inconsistencies. I think it can now serve as the base template for other scripts.
        needs testing to confirm that the new Add-EMSRemote will work in EMS, rEMS, and v2ps EMS on servers.

    # 11:26 AM 10/21/2015 fixed rampant issues created by OEV's non-standard OU naming choices: had a Generic*Win7*Computers ou, that had to be one-off excluded, and also had GPOTest users that likewise had to be excluded to ensure only a single OU came through.

        .DESCRIPTION
        preview-EAPUpdate.ps1 - Code to approximate EmailAddressTemplate-generated email addresses
        Note: This is a quick & dirty *approximation* of the generated email address. 
        Doesn't support multiple %rxy replaces on mult format codes. Just does the first one; plus any non-replace %d|s|i|m|g's. 

        Don't *rely* on this. It's just intended to quickly confirm assigned primarysmtpaddress roughly matches the intended EAP template.
        If it doesn't, put eyes on it and *confirm*, don't use this to drive any revision of the email address!

    REVISIONS   :
    # 3:18 PM 5/18/2021 somehow lost $credOpTORSID, so flipped lost default $credOPTor -> $credTORSID
    * 1:57 PM 3/31/2021 wrapped long lines for vis
    * 8:30 AM 10/22/2020 ren'd $TentantTag -> $TenOrg, swapped looping meta resolve with 1-liner approach ; added AcceptedDom caching to the middle status test (suppress one more get-exoaccepteddomain call if possible), replaced all $Meta.value with the $TenOrg version
    * 1:19 PM 10/15/2020 converted connect-exo to Ex2010, adding onprem validation

        .DESCRIPTION
        remove-SmtpPlusAddress - Strips any Plus address Tag present in an smtp address, and returns the base address

        Plus Addressing is supported in Exchange Online, Gmail, and other select hosts. 
        It is *not* supported for Exchange Server onprem. Any + addressed email will read as an unresolvable email address. 
        Supporting systems will truncate the local part (in front of the @), after the +, to resolve the email address for normal routing:

        monitoring+whatever@domain.tld, is cleaned down to: monitor@domain.tld. 

        .PARAMETER EmailAddress
        SMTP Email Address
        .OUTPUT
        String
        .EXAMPLE
        PS> 
        PS> $returned = remove-SmtpPlusAddress -EmailAddress 'monitoring+SolarWinds@toro.com';  
        PS> $returned ; 
        Demo retrieving get-EmailAddress, assigning to output, processing it for version info, and expanding the populated returned values to local variables. 
        .EXAMPLE
        ps> remove-SmtpPlusAddress -EmailAddress 'monitoring+SolarWinds@toro.com;notanemailaddresstoro.com,todd+spam@kadrie.net' -verbose ;
        Demo with comma and semicolon delimiting, and an invalid address (to force a regex match fail error).

    REVISIONS
    * 2:16 PM 6/24/2024: rem'd out #Requires -RunasAdministrator; sec chgs in last x mos wrecked RAA detection 
    * 11:21 AM 9/16/2021 string clean
    * 3:27 PM 8/23/2021 revised patched in new preview-EAPUpdate() support; added 
    default EAP cheatsheet output dump to console; suppress get-EAP warning ; 
    revised recipientfilter support to simple ($(existingRcpFltr) -AND (alias -eq $rcp.alias)).
    Much less complicated, should work on any eap with a recip fltr. 
    * 3:00 PM 8/19/2021 tested, fixed perrotpl issue (overly complicated rcpfltr), 
    pulls a single recipient back on a match on any domain. Considered running a 
    blanket 'get all matches' on each, and then post-filtering for target user(s) 
    but: filtered to a single recip in the rcptfilter, takes 8s for @toro.com; for 
    all targeted is's 1m+. And, just running for broad matches, wo considering 
    priority isn't valid: higher priority matches shut down laters, so you *need* 
    to run them in order, one at a time, and quit on first match. You can't try to 
    datacolect & postfilter wo considering priority, given user may match mult EAPs.

    .DESCRIPTION
    resolve-RecipientEAP.ps1 - Resolve an array of recipients against the onprem local EmailAddressPolicies, and return the matching/applicable EAP Policy object
    Runs a single recipient (rather than an array) because you really can't pre-collect full populations and stop. Need to run the EAPs in priority order, filter population returned, and quit on first match.
    .PARAMETER  Recipient
    Array of recipient descriptors: displayname, emailaddress, UPN, samaccountname[-recip some.user@domain.com]
    .PARAMETER useEXOv2
    Use EXOv2 (ExchangeOnlineManagement) over basic auth legacy connection [-useEXOv2]
    .PARAMETER useAltFilter
    Switch to attempt broad append '(existing) -AND (Alias -eq '`$(alias)' to eap.recipientfilter, rather than fancy search/replc on clauses (defaulted TRUE) [-useAltFilter]
    .INPUTS
    None. Does not accepted piped input
    .OUTPUTS
    System.Management.Automation.PSCustomObject of matching EAP
    .EXAMPLE
    PS> $matchedEAP = resolve-RecipientEAP -rec SOMEACCT@DOMAIN.COM -verbose ;
    PS> if($matchedEAP){"User matches $($matchedEAP.name"} else { "user matches *NO* existing EAP! (re-run with -verbose for further details)" } ; 
    .EXAMPLE
    "user1@domain.com","user2@domain.com"|%{resolve-RecipientEAP -rec $_ -verbose} ; 
    Foreach-object loop an array of descriptors

    REVISIONS
    * 2:58 PM 11/26/2025 fixed bug in $Version -OR $AllVersions test: pre-blanked $smsg (failing when it inherited data from calling ap)
    * 10:27 AM 11/24/2025 updated CBH, ref to xopBuilLibrary.psm1\Get-SetupTextVersionTDO, for clarity, updated table to reflect lastest SE, 2019 & 2016 builds:
        EXSE_RTM_Oct25SU EX2019_CU15_Oct25SU EX2016_CU23_Oct25SU (rest are unmodified); pulled irrelev AddedCredit ref to 821's similar limited vers (below)
    * 9:24 AM 10/22/2025 FIXED REGION TAGS
    * 10:22 AM 9/25/2025 ADD: -AllVersions to return the raw versions table ; added IsInstallable field, to tag installable base RTM/SP/CU releases; 
        CBH: add fields specs for -AllVersions; 
        add: demos for postfiltering -AllVersions returned data to find installable 
    * 4:07 PM 9/24/2025 flip return from [hashtable] to [pscustomobject]; 
         add alias & param alias for install-Exchange15-TTC.ps1\Get-FileVersion() emulation; pull -LongBuildNumber: the shift to [system.version]$Version obviates differences: 
        it autoflattens zero-pads to short format when .tostring()'d. So all compares are effectively to the shortversionnumber, regardless of input format.
    * 4:25 PM 9/23/2025 flipped -Version [string]->[version], does it's own type validation; updated table added NickName in format: EX[vers]_[SpCU]_[HuSu]
    * 4:02 PM 9/22/2025 init; Updated BuildToProductName indexed hash to specs posted as of 04/25/2025 at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/new-features/build-numbers-and-release-dates

    .DESCRIPTION
    Resolve-xopBuildSemVersToTextNameTDO - Resolves Exchange Server SemanticVersion BuildNumber to MS Build/Release information details
    
        > Note: xopBuildLibrary.psm1\Get-SetupTextVersionTDO is another option of much more limited utility: 
        > Duped from install-Exchange15-TTC.ps1, solely to support out of band calls to that function:
        > - Works with a static array of recent builds of installable RTM/SP/CU builds. 
        > - by contrast verb-ex2010\xopBuildSemVersToTextNameTDO() covers every version of Exchange Server back to 4.0, including every SU & HU. Issue between the two, 
        >     is Resolve-xopBuildSemVersToTextNameTDO's ProductName reflects MS's version doc page string; 
        >     while xopBuildLibrary.psm1\Get-SetupTextVersion() returns a non-standard name for the same build/CU 
        >     ('Exchange Server 2016 CU23 (2022H1)' v 'Exchange Server 2016 Cumulative Update 23')
        >     Retaining both, to avoid changing rev version strings already stored in server build state .xml files

    -AllVersions fields (and those in use in source table):
    - Most, aside from PatchBasis, NickName & 'IsInstallable' are the field names and data directly lifted from the source MS table above
    - ProductName | the "official" MS name for the RTM/SP/CU/SU/HU release (ReleaseToManuf,ServicePack,CumulativeUpdate,ServiceUpdate,HotfixUpdate)
    - ReleaseDate | documented release date
    - BuildNumberShort | SemanticVersion string with 0-padding removed
    - BuildNumberLong |  SemanticVersion string with 0-padding intact
    - PatchBasis | The most recent full IsInstallable RTM/SP/CU prior to a given HU,SU 'patch'
    - NickName | converted from ProductName: 1) subst 'EX' for 'Exchange\sServer', 2) Move 'Update\sRollup\s\d+' prefix to suffix, 3) subst '_' for '\s', 4) remove parenthesis, 5) replace 'Standard\sEdition' w 'SE'
    - IsInstallable | represents an RTM, SP or CU release in setup.exe-installable ISO or CAB availablility: e.g. the baseline installs that get patched with later CU/SU/HU updates to reach fully patched status.

    ## To Update `$xopBuilds table in this function to current published specs:

    1. Review https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/new-features/build-numbers-and-release-dates for updates
    2. Copy updates across releases (each is in a separate subtable, listed in descending release order) into the xopTable
        - Simplest accomplished by using Excel to do formatting and editing and appending the entries into proper placese
        - Be sure to construct NickName, note the PatchBasis, and specify IsInstallable status (if it's an RTM, SP or CU)
        - Then File > Save As a csv unicode encoded. 
        - then import and reparse the csv into markdowntable format, used as the data source in the xopBuilds inputs below:
        ``````powershell
        $builds = import-csv -path c:\pathto\UpdatedBuilds.csv ; 
        $builds | verb-io\convertto-Markdowntable ; 
        ```
        - copy the displayed console markdown table to clipboard, and paste into the $xopBuilds hashtable between @" and "@.
        Update the $lastBuildTableUpedate below to reflect the date of update: Note, 
        the date displayed at the top of the table, as of 9/25/2025, is *not* the 
        latest update time, it's the original time the article was posted.  

        There is no visible timestamp on the page to indicate last content update, simply you will find later revs at the tops of the tables on the page.

            .DESCRIPTION
            convertFrom-MarkdownTable.ps1 - Converts a Markdown table to a PowerShell object.
            Also supports convesion of variant 'border' md table syntax (e.g. each line wrapped in outter pipe | chars)
            Intent is as a simpler alternative to here-stringinputs for csv building. 
            .PARAMETER markdowntext
            Markdown-formated table to be converted into an object [-markdowntext 'title text']
            .INPUTS
            Accepts piped input.
            .OUTPUTS
            System.Object[]
           .EXAMPLE
           PS> $svcs = Get-Service Bits,Winrm | select status,name,displayname | 
              convertTo-MarkdownTable -border | ConvertFrom-MarkDownTable ;  
           Convert Service listing to and back from MD table, demo's working around border md table syntax (outter pipe-wrapped lines)
          .EXAMPLE
           PS> $mdtable = @"
        |EmailAddress|DisplayName|Groups|Ticket|
        |---|---|---|---|
        |da.pope@vatican.org||CardinalDL@vatican.org|999999|
        |bozo@clown.com|Bozo Clown|SillyDL;SmartDL|000001|
        "@ ; 
              $of = ".\out-csv-$(get-date -format 'yyyyMMdd-HHmmtt').csv" ; 
              $mdtable | convertfrom-markdowntable | export-csv -path $of -notype ;
              cat $of ;

                "EmailAddress","DisplayName","Groups","Ticket"
                "da.pope@vatican.org","","CardinalDL@vatican.org","999999"
                "bozo@clown.com","Bozo Clown","SillyDL;SmartDL","000001"

            Example simpler method for building csv input files fr mdtable syntax, without PSCustomObjects, hashes, or invoked object creation.
            .EXAMPLE
            PS> $mdtable | convertFrom-MarkdownTable | convertTo-MarkdownTable -border ; 
            Example to expand and dress up a simple md table, leveraging both convertfrom-mtd and convertto-mtd (which performs space padding to align pipe columns)

        .DESCRIPTION
        Puts a Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 computer into maintenance mode. CmdLet will - ;
                    - drain queues ;
                    - restart transport services ;
                    - redirect messages to a redirection server ;
                    - move off active database copies to an available DAG member ;
                    - suspend the cluster node ;
                    - prevent database activation on the server ;
                    - suspend passive copies ;
                    - set all server component states to inactive ;

        issue: Ex16 Connect-ExchangeServer -auto -ClientApplication:ManagementShell"
        If it can't find the local - services down - it WILL DIVERT INTO older EXCH versions!
        WHICH DOESN'T SEE EX16 SERVERS IN GET-EXCHANGESERVER!
        So we need to version check the session we pull (and use the -serverFQDN param of connect-Exchangeserver()), to ensure we got the server we want.

            get-exchangeserver [server] returns Admindisplayversion like :
            Version nn.n (Build nnn.n)
            The Buildnumber Shortstring can be constructed by combining the 'Version nn.n' digits with the '(Build nnn.n)' digits: nn.n.nnn.n

                [regex]::Matches($AdminDisplayVersion,"(\d*\.\d*)").value -join '.'

            Do matching on the nn.n for each Major rev, if you want to be sure of your supported commandset targets
                - 2019, 'Version 15.2'
                - 2016, 'Version 15.1'
                - 2013, 'Version 15.0'

                - 2010, 'Version 14.0'

        .PARAMETER Identity ;
        Specify the identity of the Exchange Server. This can be piped from Get-ExchangeServer or specified explicitly using a string.
        .PARAMETER RedirectionTarget ;
        Specify the identity of the Exchange Server you wish to redirect pending messages to.
        .PARAMETER MoveActiveDatabaseCopies ;
        Specify whether to move active database copies to other DAG members, if possible. The default is false.
        .INPUTS
        None. Does not accepted piped input.(.NET types, can add description)

            AI Overview
            The Redirect-Message cmdlet in Exchange Server is used to redirect active messages from the delivery queues of one Mailbox server to another. This is typically done during maintenance or troubleshooting to move email traffic off a server that is being taken offline. While Redirect-Message is primarily used with Mailbox servers, it can also interact with Edge Transport servers in certain scenarios, particularly when managing mail flow between an Exchange organization and an unsubscribed Edge Transport server. 
            Here's a more detailed explanation:
            1. Redirecting Messages with Redirect-Message:

                The Redirect-Message cmdlet in the Exchange Management Shell is used to move messages from one Mailbox server to another.
                This cmdlet drains all active messages from the delivery queues on the source server and routes them to the target server.
                The source server stops accepting new messages while the redirection process is ongoing.
                Only active messages are redirected; shadow queues and poison messages are not affected.

            2. Interaction with Edge Transport Servers:

                Edge Transport Servers and Mail Flow:
                .

            Edge Transport servers act as a perimeter network for Exchange, handling inbound and outbound mail flow. 
            Edge Subscriptions:
            .
            Typically, Edge Transport servers are subscribed to an Active Directory site within the Exchange organization, which automates mail flow and configuration. 
            Unsubscribed Edge Servers:
            .
            In situations where an Edge Transport server is not subscribed, you may need to manually configure Send and Receive connectors to manage mail flow. 
            Redirecting Messages to/from Edge Servers:
            .
            While Redirect-Message primarily moves messages between Mailbox servers, it can be involved in scenarios where you need to redirect mail flow to or from an unsubscribed Edge Transport server. For example, you might redirect messages to an Edge server for processing (like address rewriting) or redirect messages from an Edge server to a Mailbox server for delivery.

            3. Example Usage (with Edge Transport):

                If you need to take an Edge Transport server offline for maintenance, you might redirect messages to a different Edge Transport server or back to Mailbox servers within the organization.

            You could use Redirect-Message in conjunction with other cmdlets like Set-ServerComponentState (to put the Hub Transport service into "Draining" mode) to manage the process.

            4. Key Considerations:

                Permissions: You need the appropriate permissions to run Redirect-Message.

            Target Server: The target server for redirection must be online and accessible. 
            Redirection Scope: Only active messages are redirected; shadow queues and poison messages are not affected.

            In summary, Redirect-Message is a powerful cmdlet for managing message flow between Exchange servers. While primarily used for Mailbox servers, it can be part of the process for managing mail flow involving Edge Transport servers, especially when dealing with unsubscribed Edge servers or maintenance scenarios.

        * 1:33 PM 7/15/2025 ported to func, added to xopBuildLibrary.ps1
        * 3:15 PM 3/27/2025 added -nostart to restore startup settings to default, but not start the services (followup with a reboot). added -identity param, and pipeline looping, along with -ComputerName spec on start-service & set-service & get-service commands, to permit remote batch runs against array of servers
            added CBH; added svc installed pretest from MS Ex16 setup servicecontrol.ps1; updated to run remotely
        * April 22, 2021 Ali Tajran's posted version
        .DESCRIPTION
        start-Ex16ServicesInDependencyOrder.ps1 - Cold start Exchange 2016 server, without any running Exchange servers of the revision online. Runs from native powershell, without any Remote EMS dependancy, also ensures all services - Automatic or Manual - startup settings are back to stock settings (restoring function after a service disable maintenance down)

        Runs a list of automatic services, and a list of manual services: 
            sets the autos to startuptype:automatic, 
            sets the manuals properly to startuptype:manual; 
            then runs both and starts the automatic startup services (the manuals should follow along automatically)

        Has advantage over the old...

        ```powershell
        Test-ServiceHealth |  Select-Object ServicesNotRunning –Expand ServicesNotrunning | Start-Service ;
        ```

        ... in that you can't use tsh, if there's no running ex to open an EMS session into. 

        This script runs in stock powershell, no dependancy on EMS or it's cmdlets.

        This also functions to reverse disable-xopExServer() (and is a configured alias on this function)

        .PARAMETER Identity ; 
        Specify the identity of the Exchange Server. This can be piped from Get-ExchangeServer or specified explicitly using a string (defaults to local computer)
        .PARAMETER nostart
        Optional switch to suppress start of servicese (e.g. solely restore normal Startup setting, and *manually* perform a follow-up reboot, to let the entire system come up refreshed) [-noStart]
        .PARAMETER TargetRole
        Role specification (Mailbox|EdgeTransport) that overrides automatic role detection (which is normally predicated on presense of MSExchangeADTopology|MSExchangeEdgeCredential services) to suppress autodetect of target role [-TargetRole EdgeTransport]
        .INPUTS

        REVISIONS
        * 5:53 PM 8/16/2025 Stop-ex16MaintenanceMode: add Edge detection support; code to do the $isDAG test within the function (and not inherited)
        * 2:30 PM 3/26/2025 merge PietroCiaccio's Disable-EPMaintenanceMode with my updates under Start-ex16MaintenanceMode.ps1
        * 9:09 AM 3/26/2025 added ipsn post connect-ExchangeServer() call (wasn't including import/non-functional [headscratch]); beyond that, used wo issues on 1st of the Ex16 builds

        .DESCRIPTION
        Stop-ex16MaintenanceMode.ps1 - Takes a Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 computer out of maintenance mode. CmdLet will: 

                - set all server component states to active
                - resume the cluster node
                - enable database activation on the server
                - resume passive database copies
                - resume transport
                - restart transport services 

        Based on PietroCiaccio's github-posted function from his ExchangePowerShell module
        https://github.com/PietroCiaccio/ExchangePowerShell

        issue: Ex16 Connect-ExchangeServer -auto -ClientApplication:ManagementShell"
        If it can't find the local - services down - it WILL DIVERT INTO older EXCH versions!
        WHICH DOESN'T SEE EX16 SERVERS IN GET-EXCHANGESERVER!
        So we need to version check the session we pull (and use the -serverFQDN param of connect-Exchangeserver()), to ensure we got the server we want.

            get-exchangeserver [server] returns Admindisplayversion like : 
            Version nn.n (Build nnn.n)
            The Buildnumber Shortstring can be constructed by combining the 'Version nn.n' digits with the '(Build nnn.n)' digits: nn.n.nnn.n
    
                [regex]::Matches($AdminDisplayVersion,"(\d*\.\d*)").value -join '.'

            Do matching on the nn.n for each Major rev, if you want to be sure of your supported commandset targets
                - 2019, 'Version 15.2'
                - 2016, 'Version 15.1'
                - 2013, 'Version 15.0'
                - 2010sp3, 'Version 14.3'
                - 2010sp2, 'Version 14.2'

        REVISIONS
        * 1:21 PM 8/12/2025 fix: start-service has no -ComputerName $server param; fix validate typo in -targetrole
        * 3:44 PM 7/15/2025 had never actually finished conv fr start-Ex16ServicesInDep, now done;  ported to func, added to xopBuildLibrary.ps1
        * 3:15 PM 3/27/2025 added -nostart to restore startup settings to default, but not start the services (followup with a reboot). added -identity param, and pipeline looping, along with -ComputerName spec on start-service & set-service & get-service commands, to permit remote batch runs against array of servers
            added CBH; added svc installed pretest from MS Ex16 setup servicecontrol.ps1; updated to run remotely

        .DESCRIPTION
        stop-Ex16ServicesInDependencyOrder.ps1 - Stop Exchange 2016 server, without any running Exchange servers of the revision online. Runs from native powershell, without any Remote EMS dependancy, also ensures all services - Automatic or Manual - startup settings are back to stock settings (restoring function after a service disable maintenance down).

        Runs a list of automatic services, and a list of manual services: 
            sets the autos to startuptype:Disabled, 
            sets the manuals to startuptype:Disabled; 
            then runs both and stops the automatic startup services (the manuals should follow along automatically)

        Has no dependancy on running ex to open an EMS session into for native EMS cmdlets

        This script runs in stock powershell, no dependancy on EMS or it's cmdlets.

        > To stop Exchange 2016 services using PowerShell and then reboot the server, first open the Exchange Management Shell as an administrator, then use the Stop-Service cmdlet to stop the services, and finally reboot the server using Shutdown /r /t 0. 
        > Here's a more detailed breakdown:
        > 1. Open Exchange Management Shell:
        > 
        >     Click the Start button, type "Exchange Management Shell", and right-click the result to select "Run as administrator".
        > 
        > 2. Stop Exchange Services:
        > 
        >     Use the Stop-Service cmdlet to stop the Exchange services you need. For example:
        > 
        > Code
        > 
        >        Stop-Service -Name MSExchangeMailboxReplication
        >        Stop-Service -Name MSExchangeTransport
        >        Stop-Service -Name MSExchangeRpcClientService
        > 
        >     You can use Get-Service to view the services and their names to ensure you are stopping the correct services.
        > 
        > 3. Reboot the Server:
        > 
        >     Use the following command to initiate a reboot:
        > 
        > Code
        > 
        >        Shutdown /r /t 0
        > 
        >     This command shuts down the server and restarts it immediately.
        > 
        > Important Considerations:
        > 
        >     Backup:
        >     Before making any significant changes, ensure you have a recent backup of your Exchange Server.
        > 
        > Order of Operations:
        > Stop services in a logical order, ensuring that dependencies are handled correctly. For example, stop the transport service before the mailbox replication service. 
        > Troubleshooting:
        > If you encounter issues, check the Exchange logs for errors and consult Microsoft documentation for troubleshooting steps. 
        > Restart IIS:
        > After stopping and starting Exchange services, you may need to restart IIS to ensure that the changes are reflected. You can do this by using the command iisreset in the command prompt.

    .DESCRIPTION
    test-ExOPPSession - Does a *simple* - NO-ORG REVIEW - validation of functional PSSession with: ConfigurationName:'Microsoft.Exchange' -AND Name match  '^(Exchange2010|Session\sfor\simplicit\sremoting\smodule\sat\s.*)' -AND State:'Opened' -AND Availability:'Available' -AND can gcm -name 'Add-ADPermission'.
    This does *NO* validation that any specific EXOnPrem org is attached! It just validates that an existing PSSession *exists* that *generically* matches a Remote Exchange Mgmt Shell connection in a usable state. Use case is scripts/functions that *assume* you've already pre-established a suitable connection, and just need to pre-test that *any* PSS is already open, before attempting commands. 
    .INPUTS
    None. Does not accepted piped input.
    .OUTPUTS
    System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.PSSession. Returns the functional PSSession object(s)

            REVISIONS
            * 10:45 AM 8/6/2025 added write-myOutput|Warning|Verbose support (for xopBuildLibrary/install-Exchange15.ps1 compat)
            * 2:58 PM 7/17/2025 updated CBH;  hybrid with prexisting vx10\test-LocalExchangeInfoTDO, combined best ideas from both; ren (again) to match existing: test-xopExchangeLocalInstallTDO -> test-LocalExchangeInfoTDO()
            * 4:09 PM 7/13/2025 add: cbh demo to test for down/disabled svcs state ;
             ren: test-xopExchangeLocalInstallTDO -> test-xopExchangeLocalInstallTDO, aliased orig ; add: all useful roles props 'isAdminTools','isCAS','isUM','isAdminTools','isCAS','isUM','isHub','isEdgeTransport' (tested in registry)
            * * 5:29 PM 7/12/2025 init; added support for version detect of Exchange Subcription Edition (identified as ExVers: ExSE, 15.2.2562+ (only differentiation from Ex2019 is that that vers is still 15.2.1748...)

        .DESCRIPTION
        test-xopExchangeInstallWatermarkTDO - Test local machine's HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ExchangeServer\v* registry sub-keys for Watermark values (a Watermark value indicates failed/incomplete install stage)

        Tests HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ExchangeServer\v* subkeys -matching (AdminTools|ClientAccessRole|UnifiedMessagingRole|MailboxRole|FrontendTransportRole|CafeRole|EdgeTransportRole)
        for presense of a 'Watermark' value. Watermarks are set during install phases, and should be auto-removed as the stage completes.
        Their presense after an install/patch applicacation indicates an issue with the specified install phase.
        This is generally addressed by re-running the install/patch, specifying the specific role that failed/has a Watermark subkey.

        E.g. for the MailboxRole, rerun the prior commandline, with /roles: limited to the Watermark'd role names:

        CMD> setup.exe /mode:install /roles:Mailbox /IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms_DiagnosticDataOFF /DoNotStartTransport /InstallWindowsComponents /MdbName:MDB1 /DBFilePath:"F:\LYNMS6400\MDB1\DB\MDB1.edb" /LogFolderPath:"F:\LYNMS6400\MDB1\Log" /TargetDir:"D:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15"

        This function essentially emulates the commandline registry check:
        CMD> Reg.exe query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ExchangeServer\v15 /s /v Watermark

        Which would return a Registry Watermark in the format:

            HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ExchangeServer\v15\MailboxRole
            Watermark    REG_SZ    SystemAttendantDependent___1DEE95834DBA48F2BB211C2FB6765A5A

        .INPUTS
        None, no piped input.
        .OUTPUTS
        Returns matched watermark keys to pipeline
        .EXAMPLE
        PS> $WatermrkTest = test-xopExchangeInstallWatermarkTDO ;
        PS> if($WatermrkTest){;
        PS>     write-warning $WatermrkTest ; 
        PS> }

            Found value 'Watermark' in key 'Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\Registry::HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ExchangeServer\v15\MailboxRole':
